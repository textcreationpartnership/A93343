            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſe things be ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in ſuch a day as this is, wherein ſuch a multitude of Profeſſors of all ſorts do abound, who have enjoyed ſo long a time of peace and proſperity, which are apt in themſelves, through our carnal hearts, to lull us faſt aſleep in the bed of ſloath and carnal Security, and to be get a ſpiritual Lethargy in the Soul.</p>
            <p>To awaken us and to provoke one another to this great duty, let us call to mind our former dayes, when we were firſt illuminated, how great a zeal did then poſſeſs us, what care, what diligence, that we might be found appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, in the ſight of God, who judgeth the hearts, and tryeth the reins? It is the ſad complaint of diſcerning Chriſtians this day, (and is there not a cauſe!) that there is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Decay and decreaſe of Godlineſs, in the power and life thereof among profeſſors. <hi>This is a Lamentation, and it ſhall be for a Lamentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It does therefore exceedingly concern all Chriſtians of what rank ſoever, ſeriouſly to
<pb facs="tcp:123663:3"/> ſearch and examine their own hearts, and to cry, what have we done! what is the matter! ſurely the diſpenſation that is upon us at this day, is to try and to purge, and to make white, that they which are upright might be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, when the Hypocrite and formal profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, that cannot abide the tryal, ſhall ſtumble and fall, and the ſhame of their nakedneſs ſhall appear. Our lot is certainly fallen in the laſt dayes, upon whom the ends of the World are come, and our Lord himſelf hath expreſly foretold, that in the <hi>laſt dayes</hi> among Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors <hi>iniquity ſhall abound, and the love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall wax cold;</hi> and that then the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as well as the fooliſh, will all ſlumber and ſleep, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 13. <hi>and</hi> 25. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> fore-telling the evil of the laſt times, ſets down a black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of ſins that will be found (not among the prophane only, as in all ages) but in ſuch perſons, <hi>having a form of godlineſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the power thereof,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> abounding among Profeſſors, is the ſin and ſign of the laſt dayes. And herein we may diſcern gray and hoary hairs, more than here and there upon the head of this old World. We are fallen into the lees
<pb facs="tcp:123663:4"/> and dregs of time, and the World the older it grows, the worſe, declining now into its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant,</hi> that in ſuch a day as this is, keeps his <hi>Garment unſpotted,</hi> and his <hi>conſcience undefiled,</hi> that hath his <hi>Lamp bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and his <hi>light ſhining,</hi> and his <hi>Loyns girded,</hi> and is alwayes expecting and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his <hi>Lords coming. Bleſſed is that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſign of this enſuing Treatiſe, (which we recommend unto thy ſerious peruſal) is to ſet forth the ſad eſtats of a <hi>Dying</hi> and <hi>Decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian,</hi> ſhewing the <hi>Symptomes, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Cures</hi> of the <hi>Decay</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Benefit</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of the <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> As thou maiſt ſee in the Title and Frontiſpiece of this Book.</p>
            <p>A Subject certainly never more ſuitable and ſeaſonable than at this day, when as <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> it ſelf in the power and life of it, is at ſo low an ebb, and grows every day more than other, into a ſenſible Decay and Conſumption. And therefore this Piece needs not our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, but a greater than we are, hath Avouched this, whoſe Wiſdome and Authority
<pb facs="tcp:123663:4"/> we muſt adore; <hi>A Word fitly ſpoken,</hi> or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſeaſon, <hi>is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Author, by that acquaintance we have with him, we judge him to be an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chriſtian, and one who hath made it his buſineſs to diſcern the Signs of the Times, and we doubt not but the ſavoury Chriſtian, upon the through reading of his Book, will judge the ſame with us.</p>
            <p>Reader, we ſhall detain thee no longer in the Porch, enter the Houſe it ſelf: <hi>Come and ſee</hi> whether it perform not more than we ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Now the bleſſing of God go along with it, and with thee in the reading of it, and he that gives ſeed to the ſower, and bleſſeth the encreaſe thereof, grant unto us all, that we may remember our firſt wayes, and do our firſt works; and more abundantly; that our laſt dayes may be our beſt dayes, and our laſt works may be more than our firſt; that we may be Trees of Righteouſneſs, of the Lords own plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that we may bring forth moſt and beſt fruit in our old age, when all other Trees ceaſe to yield their encreaſe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not only poſſible, but too too common, for Chriſtians after they have been ſometime converſant in the worſhip and ſervice of Gods Houſe, to come to this declining frame of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123663:14"/> Spirit, having ſeen into ſome of the depth of that, that at their firſt convertion, being mighty new, was mighty welcome; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more natural to them becomes in ſome kind burthenſome; then Satan, that long wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, gets advantage upon them, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the caſe with them, Whether there is ſuch neceſſity of that labour and travail about their Religion, as they take; and by this means <hi>Jeroboam</hi> like, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 27, 28. When he would draw the hearts of Iſrael a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, tels them; it is too much to go up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to worſhip, and ſo makes two Calves of Gold, and puts the one in <hi>Dan</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Theſe be thy Gods O Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſuch pretences of eaſe as theſe, takes preſently with deceitful hearts, eſpecially when there is a ſhow of attaining the ſame end they looked for, with leſs coſt and charge; by this means the heart lets go thoſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful convictions wrought by the holy Spirit at his firſt taking poſſeſſion, which leads the mind out to make Religions getting and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a labour, work, or buſineſs; now lets go its firſt unwearied dilligence, and ſo takes in this Spirit of indifferency to aſſemble; which plainly diſcovers, that now but halfe the heart attends that ſpiritual ſervice, in which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123663:14"/> the body is preſent; and indeed thus much ground by a Chriſtian loſt, gives ſuch a wound to his heavenly trade; that the ſavour &amp; reliſh he had at his firſt beginning to run well, is now much departed, and ſo his appetite being withdrawn, makes his ſtomack loath or nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate that food, that once was ſavory and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
                  <p>Now what likelier way can be imagined, to hurt and ſpoil a Chriſtians Communion with his God, and ſo by little and little, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from his ſpiritual trade; then to poſſeſs his heart with ſuch kind of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency as this, even a willing negligence to aſſemble; and ſo eſtranging himſelf to Chriſt Jeſus Fould where he is wont to feed his flock at noon-day, being a ſtranger there, to the daily opportunities of ſpiritual gains, muſt needs looſe in his ſpiritual trade, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be affected with new lovers, and luſt after their unprofitable dainties; Doth not experiance ſpeak mournfully in this, and confeſs the field to be more than halfe loſt, when that early zeale to Chriſtian aſſemblings grows low; and though once remained great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burthened at material hinderances, yet now is content with ſlight excuſes, ſeeing no ſuch neceſſity, as is by zealous perſons pretended, and once by them believed, ſo often to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123663:15"/> and as by ſad experience ſome can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when others have been delightfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with Gods publick worſhip: they idling up and down, have found ſatan not a little buſie; nor his deſign a little taking, to prepare their ſpeedy ruin; For as by often rubbing hand in hand, warmth is gotten; or by often uſing working-tools ruſt is preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; even ſo a frequent aſſembling among Gods children, inclines and diſpoſeth the heart to good, and conſequently impairs and leſſens the old mans hold; being under that continual means, that renews and inclines the mind into a ſpiritual likeneſs, to Chriſt its head; and ſo is wrought up to a ſpiritual complyance with every new motion to good performances; ſaying with <hi>David, When thou ſaidſt, ſeek my face, my heart ſaid, thy face Lord will I ſeek, Pſal.</hi> 27. 8. no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaith God; ſeek my face, but without delay, <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſaith, thy face Lord will I ſeek; I was glad when they ſaid, <hi>Come let us go into the houſe of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 122. 1. it was joy to <hi>David</hi> to ſee Perſons ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their true good, as to be forward to aſſemble.</p>
                  <p>All this premiſed, beſpeaks this indifferency to aſſemble, of a very bad tendency, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving beholders to underſtand, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123663:15"/> good things, were not eſteemed ſo much as good by ſuch Perſons; as they was ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as new, we have ſad inſtances, of this kind of ſpiritual decay, in <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 4, 5, 6. <hi>The mixt multitude that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, fell a luſting, and ſaid, who ſhall give us fleſh to eat; we remember the fiſh which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons; and the leeks, and the onyons, but now our ſouls is dryed away, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all beſides this Manna before our eyes.</hi> ſo Chap. 2. 5. <hi>And the people ſpake againſt God, and againſt</hi> Moſes; ſaying, <hi>wherefore have ye brought us out of Egypt to dye in this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; for there is no bread, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny water; and our ſouls loath this light bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here Gods own inſtitution, that once was welcome to them, and being now, they was mighty eager after it, in ſo much that they could diſpence with breaking a law, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. at large proves; where we read of its firſt inſtitution: this <hi>Manna</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 25. calls An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels food: they now loath, and call light bread; this <hi>Manna</hi> though Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, that fed them to the full, and was to continue with them till they come to eat the old corne, in the Land of promiſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:123663:16"/> 5. 12. yet this they loath under its conſtant injoyment, and wiſh for <hi>Egypts</hi> food a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>How zealous were perſons in this age, ten or twelve years ago, when truth begun more clearly to break forth, no coſt or early pains mattered; happy were they that could come ſooneſt; then were aſſemblies crouded; good men incouraged to labor, Gods name delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully worſhipped; in ſo much, that without wrong one might ſay, ſince ſuch dayes the Kingdome of Heaven have ſuffered violence, and the violent take it by force: is Gods hand ſhortned, that ſuch workings of heart are not now as was then? is not now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies thin, performances ſmall, ſeldome and late? is it becauſe God is a Wilderneſs to his people? is it not becauſe they ſurfeit under fulneſs? Doth not many run too and fro, that knowledge is increaſed, and ſons and daughters propheſie? How then may this ſerve to rebuke that ſloathful Spirit in any, that are careleſs to aſſemble, and calls on them to be reſtleſs with God, till they are again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to ſuch a Spirit of zeal, as they had in the dayes of their firſt Eſpouſal; lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, being that inlet ſin, to ſpiritual ſpoiling; diſappointing God of gratious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to inrich them, and thorow this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123663:16"/> neglectance, offers daring occaſion to the Devil to tempt them; Doth not the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. plainly imply an impoſſibility of believing in him, of whom they have not heard: <hi>And how ſhall they hear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>without a Preacher, as it is written?</hi> how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things? doth not this ſaying, in ſo many words declare the reaſon of periſhing, to be want of knowledge? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. And the cauſe of ignorance, the want of preaching: How doth this then commend Gods high approbation of aſſembling, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper ſeaſon for preaching. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord heard it; and a book of remembrance was written, before him for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name:</hi> In an evil time when many grew weary, and ſaid, it is a vain thing to ſerve the Lord, &amp; what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and walked mournfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; then ſuch as met often, were high in Gods account.</p>
                  <p>Alas, alas, is not preaching, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with never ſo much inward and outward pains-taking, then matter of ſcorn to ſtanders by, who live vainly; alſo a joy to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123663:17"/> the Devil our grand adverſary, when few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and of thoſe, moſt part flat, low, indiſpoſed, and weary, having little ſpiritual life or vigor in them; on whom common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to aſſemble, hath eaten out the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reliſh, that ſhould be in them: but I ſhall cloſe this with Gods counſel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25. <hi>Let us conſider one another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto love, and good works. Not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome is: but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as we ſee the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. For if we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> Doth not this diſmall concluſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. proffer it ſelf, as the moſt probable end of ſuch as ceaſe to aſſemble, and makes way for their fearful and inevitable ruine? ſhall any dare then to content themſelves with light excuſes, to hinder their aſſembling, and not rather provoke and exhort one another to ſo good a work?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this firſt Sign, of dying to Chriſt, with offering briefly three Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, how it may be removed, where begun; or prevented, where like to come.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider and lay to heart; That to aſſemble is a very weighty duty, and requires
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123663:17"/> all your heart; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 3. <hi>Encline your ear, &amp; come unto me, hear, &amp; your ſouls ſhall live;</hi> ſee Prov. 8. 34, 35. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching dayly at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors: for who ſo findeth me, findeth life, and ſhall obtain favour of the Lord.</hi> Plainly noting, that diligent heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which cannot be without aſſembling, is the way to life; therefore not to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked at, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Every ſoul that will not hear this Prophet, ſhall be cut off from amongſt the People;</hi> Perſons may think it a light thing to forbear hearing, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence onely to the aſſembly; but God will count it a deſpiſing him, and the means he hath ordained; <hi>The Chrildren of</hi> Ephraim <hi>being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of Battel: they kept not Gods Covenant, but refuſed to walk in his Law: therefore the Lord heard this; and a fire was kindled in his wrath againſt</hi> Jacob; <hi>For their hearts was not right with God:</hi> Let us take heed therefore, that we refuſe not him that ſpake from Heaven; but as we muſt conſider, that it is a weighty duty to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo it requires that we come with all our hearts; this God calls for, and where it is wanting, performances will not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <hi>This people draw nigh me with their</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:123663:18"/> 
                     <hi>mouths, and honour me with their lips; but their heart is far from me,</hi> Iſa. 29. 13. it is Gods complaint by <hi>Jeremiah, Juda hath not turned to me with her whole heart, but fainedly;</hi> with a heart and a heart, a heart as much a contrary way, as that way; they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as willing not to turn as to turn; this makes offerings to be abhord, the contrary by Chriſtians muſt be made at; <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſeek him with their whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119. 25. Leſſe then the whole heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets jarring, prevents harmony, hinders the ſpiritual building.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Remedy, is to conſider, that it is not poſſible to prevent this ſpirit of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, but by continuing as induſtruous to keep what ye have gained, as you were to get it, the prayers, the teares, the ſearchings of heart, the attentive hearing, and frequent aſſemblings, that you in order to your firſt Eſpouſal did diligently follow, you muſt ſtill hold on in; that you may keep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſame, for the promiſes run in no other channel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>If thou ſeek for wiſdome as for ſilver, and ſearch for it as for hid treaſure: Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</hi> Hoſ. 6. 3. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:123663:18"/> 
                     <hi>prepared as the morning; and he ſhall come to us as the raine; the latter and former raine unto the earth.</hi> God will be to ſuch as follow on to know him in his way, as the former and latter raine is to the earth, which without it is dry and barren, but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed therewith, proves green and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Now alaſs perſons when once they are gotten in Chriſts Fould, think their work well nigh done, but God knows it is but then begun, their Labour before was but to come into the vineyard, and there I am ſure they muſt not be idle; they are put there to work, to be lights to others, and ſhew forth Chriſts vertues; and there God will prune them, dreſſe them water them, but it is that they may be fruitfull, elſe they muſt be plucked up as cumberrers of the ground; do not therefore think your work is now neer done, for you are but now begun, you are now entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the warr; liſted under your Captain Chriſt Jeſus, and muſt till death, continue fighting, ſtriving, and overcoming, that at laſt you may overcome: therefore if you read, prayed, faſted, watched, weeped, aſſembled much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now do it much more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We labour,</hi> (or made a buſineſs of it) <hi>to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God;</hi> and ſaith the holy Apoſtle
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123663:19"/> 
                     <hi>Peter,</hi> writing to them which had obtained like precious faith, through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and Jeſus Chriſt our Savour; and had eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt, exhorts them, <hi>to give all diligence to add to their faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knewledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs love; for if theſe things be in you and abound, they make you neither barren nor unfruitful: But if they lack theſe things, they are blind, and cannot ſet a farr off, but have forgotten they was purged from their old ſins,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 2. One would think, that perſons that had gone thus farr, as to obtain like precious faith with Gods elect, and were purged from their old ſins, having eſcaped (or were eſcaping) the corruption that is in the world through luſt, might have well nigh done their work, yet the holy Ghoſt here ſhews them, that now their work is but begun; and ſaith, they muſt give <hi rend="blackletterType">All diligence;</hi> ſo ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philipians. Chap.</hi> 2. 12, <hi>My brethren, as you have alwaies obeyed, both in my preſence, &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling;</hi> from all this we may learn, that its no being idle in Chriſts Vineyard, if
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123663:19"/> it coſt us much diligence to get in, it muſt coſt us <hi rend="blackletterType">much more to keep in:</hi> ſo I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this ſecond Remedy, with the holy Ghoſts counſel to the Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Chap. 6. 11, 12. <hi rend="blackletterType">And</hi>
                     <hi> we deſire that every one of you </hi>(<hi rend="blackletterType">marke it well</hi>)<hi> do ſhew the ſame diligence to the full aſſurance of hope to the end, that you be not </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">ſloathful,</hi>
                     <hi> but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a third Remedy may be this, that you would humbly and conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to profit ſomething in every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, make it your care to be ſtill doing or geting good, then you are about your daies work, content not your ſelves to come together from day to day, and wait under the miniſtry, going a way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gain; but come to the aſſembly with ſenſibility of many things you yet want; this will quicken your zeal, ripen your expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prepare way for God that delights to be rich in giving, to give you richly.</p>
                  <p>You will profit little, though you want never ſo much, if you are little ſenſible of your wants; and God will give you little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you will be but capable to improve lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for where the ſence of want is low, there the pulſe God-ward will beat faintly; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more doth occaſion this indifferency to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123663:20"/> aſſemble, then ſeeing it amount to little in the profit and advantage to perſons that are frequent in attending, it makes them count, better ſtay at home, than be never the better for their meeting together, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>You have ſaid it is a vain thing to ſerve the Lord; and what profit is it that we have keept his ordinances, and walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> They went not ſurely the right way to expect profit, nor had their eye upon right profit; but ſomething they did propoſe to themſelves in coming that they got not; and ſo cries out, it is in vain to ſerve him; it is even thus among profeſſors now, if they ſee meetings come to little, though the fault be only in themſelves, it ends to make them think lightly of aſſembling; <hi>Who is there among you,</hi> ſaith God; <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>that would ſhut the doors for naught, or kindle a fire on my Altar for naught; he that ploweth ploweth in hope, &amp; he that ſoweth ſoweth in hope;</hi> that is, perſons that do work, expect and count upon fruit therefrom; they will not do it for nothing, and indeed it is but reaſonable, he that plants a vineyard ſhould drink of the wine thereof; great layings out, preparing the heart for expectations of great returns; and when perſons do lay out, &amp; count upon anſwerable returns, as they righteouſly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123663:20"/> may, God being pleaſed they ſhould, and this coming to paſs tends much to their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, I have gone (long to the aſſemblies, and gone on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſenſible of many wants, and have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon to profit, (as here you direct me) yet for al this I am ready to grow weary, for I ſee it come to little, I am ſtill ſhalow in my underſtanding and weake in my memory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall anſwer this objection two ways: firſt, by praying you to enquire, whether that little you do know, and have learned, you do put into practiſe; What can ingage God more to teach you to know more, than walking up to what you do know? <hi>Oh thou that art named the houſe of</hi> Jacob; <hi>is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord ſtraitned, are theſe his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Doth not my words do good to them, that walks uprightly,</hi> Mica. 2. 7. ſee to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you live not much ſhort of what you do know, and if you find you do, as ſome ſuch defect muſt needs be the cauſe, why you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſo little, then you will ſee great reaſon, God ſhould not truſt you with five Talents, ſeeing you improve not two.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, ſeeing you do profit little, <hi rend="blackletterType">Be troubled much,</hi> let it be your burthen; while perſons in aſſembling gain but little,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123663:21"/> and are but little troubled, they are not like to have their condition much mended: To come often and profit little, is very ſad; but to be unſenſible of ones wants is much ſadder: Whereas on the contrary, to be in want, and ſo ſenſible of ones want, that they go burthened up and down, is the beſt way to get remedy; when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in affliction, ſome that were concerned to bear part of his burthen, were ſo unſenſible, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains againſt them, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. <hi>They were not grieved at the affliction of Joſeph;</hi> they were ſo far from eaſing him, or freeing themſelves from provoking of God to bring them into ſuch like trouble, that they were not ſo much as grieved; had no burthen upon them, were therefore fit matter to be indeed deſervedly brought themſelves into the like condition; a moſt remarkable and profitable example, if heeded by Chriſtians; we have to this very purpoſe, in <hi>Daniel</hi> that holy man, Chap. 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. when he underſtands by reading, that there were a number of years for <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems</hi> captivity, how was he burthened that he might know it, is evident, if you read but what he did, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>I ſet my face to ſeek the Lord God by prayer and ſupplication; with faſting, and ſack-cloth and aſhes;</hi> behold here a gracious pattern for Chriſtians, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123663:21"/> want to know great things from God, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſets his face unto the Lord, with ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations attending this performance, as though <hi>Daniel</hi> would be content with no denial; ſo Chap. 10. 2, 3. <hi>A thing was revealed to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, <hi>but the time appointed was long; In thoſe dayes, I</hi> Daniel <hi>was mourning three full weeks.

                  <head>SIGN II. <hi>VVHen in your pureſt Worſhip, you are quickly weary.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>It is poſſible to come to this paſs, at but a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming occaſion, and perſons create ſome kind of pretence why they are weary; if it happen that at ſome time they are not ſo particularly and perſonally concerned, in that part of Gods Worſhip, where they are preſent; It ſo falling out, that the matter God is intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, they are not ſo at want in, or what is preached, they to ſome conſiderable degree are informed in already: This may fall out in numerous Congregations, where different conditions miniſters different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as to the manner of carrying on their Worſhip; and though at ſuch a time for a growing Chriſtian, there is no room to be weary, he being as well delighted occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear, or pray over again what he knows, as he is to hear what he knows not: in the one he takes occaſion to praiſe for what was;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123663:23"/> in the other, to praiſe for what is; yet decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning perſons will in ſuch a caſe as this, when they are not ſo nearly concerned, take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage not only to be weary, but from hence plead their juſtification ſo to be; but this Sign ſpeaks to perſons under a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſuch as in their pureſt Worſhip are quickly weary, in their moſt intimate, private, perſonal, cloſet performances, retired from company, and ſet to the moſt intimate Worſhip of God, in faſting, praying, ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining, and the like; yea, from a ſenſe of mighty Need drawn to this, and yet quickly weary, muſt needs argue them deep in this decay; and that in ſuch there is a very ſtrong combate, who ſhall now gain the field, they being a weary in their pureſt Worſhip: It is evident hence, that the enemy hath got more than ordinary advantage, and ſtrikes now at the very root of their Religion, aiming at once as it were, to make a ſpeedy end; and puts ſuch Chriſtians, inſtead of Worſhiping faintly, to ceaſe Worſhiping at all; its high time therefore at the firſt ſight of ſuch decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which in our dayes is not the portion of a few; for ſurely, ſurely, many there are in Churches, that in their pureſt Worſhip are quickly weary; I ſay again, its high time, that thoſe that find the caſe thus with them, do
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123663:23"/> even like the <hi>Ninevites</hi> at the preaching of <hi>Jonah; They beleived God, proclaimed a faſt from the greateſt to the leaſt,</hi> Jonah 3. 5. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo let ſuch go to their knees, humble themſelves, and cry mightily that they periſh not.</p>
                  <p>Now the Cauſes of this decay, ſeems to be theſe three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Self-conceitedneſs that they know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Luke-warmneſs in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Unaptneſs to perſonal Duties: Which may ſerve as helps to remove it, where begun; or prevent it, where like to come.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Self-conceitedneſſe, that they know enough; Now this comes to paſs, either;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Through ignorance of what they ought to know: or,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Through Carleſneſs to put in practiſe what they do know.</p>
                  <p>Let the Law of God, as the Law of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be never ſo plain in it ſelf l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d down, yet without ſtudious induſtry to underſtand what is Gods own injunction, we may remain ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſame, and that ignorance prove a ſin to us, it being the effect of ſloathfulneſs, contrary to, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. beginning; <hi>If thou ſeek for wiſdome as for ſilver, and ſearch,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:123663:24"/> (mark that) <hi>for it as for hid treaſure; then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledg of God,</hi> Pſal. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Through careleſneſs to put in practice what they do know; perſons are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to complain of their ignorance of plain duties, yea, as though they were holden and hindred, when as all experience ſpeaks, the only way to know more is to put in practice what we do know already; <hi>Thou oughteſt therefore to have put my money to the exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and then at my coming I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived mine own, with advantage,</hi> Mat. 25. 27.</p>
                  <p>A Second Cauſe may be luke-warmneſs in Religion; that is, ſo indifferent, that they care not whether they go forward or backward; <hi>I know thy works, that thou art, neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot; ſo then becauſe thou art luke-warm, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth,</hi> Revel. 3. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a third Cauſe of this decay, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptneſs to perſonal duties; every profeſſor in order to his growing, hath perſonal duties conſtantly to carry about with him, aptneſs wherein fits him for publick imployment; but the contrary, makes him unhandy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in the word of righteouſneſs; as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by vertuous education; or the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123663:24"/> ſouldier, by frequent diſcipline, are both made ready for man-liker actions; even ſo, aptneſs in perſonal duties, as family and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet prayer, family and cloſet reading, a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exerciſe, and execution of thoſe choyce and nearly concerned duties, (with theſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) of frequent faſtings, watchings, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, patience, meekneſs, temperance, zeal, fear, love; giving all diligence, for if theſe things be in you and abound, they make you that you ſhall be neither barren nor unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but he that lacketh theſe things is blind, and cannot ſee a far off: ſo briefly I paſs to the third Sign.</p>

                  <p>By Often here, I would not be underſtood ſo, as that thoſe that preach, ſhould day after day when they aſſemble without intermiſſion, preach the very ſame thing word for word to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:123663:25"/> their hearers; for indeed this may give juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of burthen to the hearer, therefore ſuch preaching upone truth in reſpect of the ſeaſon muſt ſurely be ſo obſerved, as to leave room for the making known other truths, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be believed; therefore, let the conſiderate Reader in this caſe, conſtrue my words, as he upon another caſe judgeth he ought to conſtrue the holy Apoſtles words, <hi>Often,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. <hi>As often as you eat this bvead;</hi> Often here, doth not in the leaſt intend, that not at all perſons be in this ſervice, neither doth it ſurely intend, that they do it every time they meet together, but ſo do it as it have its ſeaſon of being adminiſtred, and ſuch ſeaſon as may not extinguiſh, or leave no room for the adminiſtration of other Ordinances; ſo that by Often, I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, ſo frequent a preaching, the ſame truth already known and believed, as ſtands with the wiſdome and judgment of perſons, that by God are intruſted to Preach: with this alwayes premiſed, that as they ſee a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any truth loſing its proper force in the memory and heart, through want of repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. And when ſuitable truths upon this very ſcore is over and over preached, and meets with ſuch Spirits as care not to hear it, that are mindleſs, careleſs, and diſpleaſed;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123663:25"/> this beſpeaks ſuch to be of the dying hand; for indeed, ſuch carriages withſtands Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method; which he frequently uſeth in Scripture to his own people in covenant with him; for two great ends, the one is, that they may remember it; the other is, that they may do it.</p>
                  <p>Is not one great end of many inſtitutions impoſed on <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and they found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to commandement in the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices yearly, leaſt they ſhould forget what God would have them remember: and when they are pleaſed to chooſe them a King, it is Gods expreſs charge, when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdome, that he ſhall write him a copy of the Law, and read there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the dayes of his life; that he may learn to keep all Gods word. The ſafety of this to the ſame people, that have already believed is plainly expreſſed, and faultineſs in them that care not to hear it, plainly implyed; and one of the great ends I have now noted, is alſo a ſign in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2. <hi>Moreover bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I declare unto you the Goſpel which I preached unto you, which alſo you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and wherein you ſtand; by which alſo you are ſaved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you; unleſs you have believed in vain.</hi> Then he goeth on and ſheweth the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:123663:26"/> particulars he had preached to them, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples even ſo plain in the Letter of them, that one would think they could not be forgotten; which ſtrongly implies, that through want of preaching the ſame things to them again, they might either looſe the bare knowledge of the Principles there laid down, or at leaſt the ſpiritual force and nature of them; how then doth this very Scripture reprove ſuch as care not to hear a ſuitable truth often? charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with faultineſs in forgetting: that of all truth at beſt, they know but in part; and that by hearing one and the ſame truth again and again, a man may ſee ſome excellency further than yet he ever ſaw: experience will witneſs this to the conſiderate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. Now this defect ſeems to ariſe from ſome wrong Judgment, or apprehentions, that ſuch perſons have of themſelves; They are notionally conceited of ſome large reach they have in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe very things they care not to hear; and this defect in them is occaſioned through want of humble dependance upon God, and ſenſible feeling the Spirit of that word; <hi>All my ſprings are in thee, Pſal.</hi> 87. laſt. Let any that find the caſe thus with them, be intreated to be reſtleſs in themſelves, (not quiet or content) but pray earneſtly to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123663:26"/> God, that he would both heal them from this foul diſtemper, and alſo forgive them for this great evil, of entertaining, or giving way to burden at hearing again, that that grace hath taught them to know already.

                  <p>The greatneſs of this defect, and the danger of it may be ſeen, if ſomething be premiſed and conſidered. When you think you know enough; that is, you are grown ſo tall in the knowledge of God, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of his Houſe, the way to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the ſtrength of your adverſaries, the Fleſh, World, and Devil, and the plague of your own heart; for all this muſt be premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as being in ſuch perſons as think they know enough; if their thoughts be not groſs deceit, and then what need of Hearing or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123663:29"/> or crying after knowledge, or lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the voyce for underſtanding? Is not this groſs deceit grown ſomewhat common, but of dangerous tendency, to knock both heart and hand from off the means God hath ordained to encreaſe and ſanctifie Knowledg? Is not ſuch a conceit the road way to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme? Were it not gotten among ſome ſleepy Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time? Doth not that ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2, 3. directly aim at ſuch? <hi>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. But if any man love God, the ſame is known of him:</hi> As much as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, you think you know much, truly if you know ſo much as that you love God, you are known of him; and if you know this, you know what you can know in this life; but if you know not this, you know nothing yet as ye ought to know, whatever you think of your ſelves: and therefore look to it, that you love God, and dwell not about this or that tall conceit of your knowledge, but if you or any man love him, the ſame is known of him: And this I ſhall humbly add, if any man love God, the ſame hath learned to think ſoberly or meanly of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the danger of this appears further, if we conſider, that ſome for being under this

                  <p>Firſt, when you meaſure what you know, by your own eyes or light; you do think ſo, not meaſuring what you know by the Rule of Knowledge, the Word of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>For we dare not make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend themſelves; but they meaſuring themſelves with themſelves, by comparing themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, are not wiſe.</hi> Prov. 30. 12. <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe texts you may ſee, what miſerable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:123663:30"/> judgment men will make of things, when they walk by the light of their own eyes, contrary to Gods expreſs charge, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>You ſhall not do after all things ye hear this day, every man what is right in his own eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another Cauſe may be this, when you meaſure what you know, by what once you did know; not conſidering that further knowledge, forceth further light, and cals for proportionable practiſe: <hi>When I was a child I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When you meaſure what you know, by ſeeing others that profeſs they know, do as they do, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> Other mens actions muſt no further be a rule for us, notwithſtanding their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then as their actions accord with Gods Word, the rule of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When you meaſure what you know, by what you are diſpoſed to practiſe, or do; men pick and chooſe what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they will obſerve, and how to obſerve them, in our dayes: Some Commands ſuit more with the nature and diſpoſition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than other Commands do; they that cannot endure Drunkenneſs, can give way
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:123663:30"/> to paſſion; they that cannot endure unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can give way to Covetouſneſs; but as the victory is glorious when gotten over, what was moſt difficult; ſo meaſuring what we know, not by what we are diſpoſed to do; but what God commands us to do, is the trueſt way or rule to meaſure by; for the carnal man will make the Law of Nations his guide; the moral man the ten Commandments his guide; the Antichriſtian man the falſe Spirit his guide; and all meaſure themſelves by their guide: but the undeceived Chriſtian man, makes Gods Word his guide, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures what he knows, by his walking like that; <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Word, </hi>
                     <hi>'tis becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When you meaſure not what you know, by what God in his Word calls you perſonally to do; when thoſe eſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that lyeth upon you, as Husband to Wife, Wife to Husband, Father to Child, Child to Father, Maſter to Servant, Servant to Maſter, are left undone, or ſo lamely done, that they are full of cracks and flaws; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of ſuch is vain, and contrary compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to this, as vain and deceitful. This was the evil of the Scribes and Phariſees, they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Anniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> but <hi>neglected judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:123663:31"/> 
                     <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law:</hi> all doings are ſhows with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubſtance, while the weightier matters are left undone, <hi>James</hi> 1. 26. <hi>If any man ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, he deceives his own heart; this mans Religion is in vain:</hi> Conſider this in the fear of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But how may we know we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with this deceit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, When you have a low value of that means, that under God firſt brought you to know: Is not Sermons a low thing with you? this and that Preacher, that once was high in your account, now weak and mean in your eſteem? <hi>Now you are full, now you are rich, and have raigned as Kings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us: I would to God you did raign, that we alſo might raign with you,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When you are mighty prodigal of what you know, thinking no matter well mannaged, that you have not moſt voyce in, Prov. 15. 2. <hi>The tongue of the wiſe uſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge aright, but the mouth of fools poureth forth fooliſhneſs.</hi> So prov. 29. 11. <hi>The fool uttereth all his mind, but a wiſe man keepeth it in while afterwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When you pleaſe your ſelf with the thoughts, that few or none in knowledge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:123663:31"/> outſtrip you, having a ſecret ſcorn to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſelves with any; that is, when you think none is able to ſay more to a text of Scripture, than you have done; or knows the holy Spirits mind more than your ſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>We are wiſe,</hi> (We by way of ſingularity,) <hi>and the Law of the Lord is with us:</hi> At the ſame time God ſaith, <hi>What wiſdome is in them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fouthly, When in all matters material, you are not careful to take counſel of God, before you bring them to action, Prov. 15. 28. <hi>The heart of the wiſe ſtudieth to anſwer, but the mouth of fools poureth forth fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And Chap. 3. 6. <hi>In all thy wayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi>

                  <p>By Chriſts Table here, I would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Chriſt Jeſus his own inſtitution the night he was betrayed; which he ſet on foot to his Penitent, Believing, Baptized Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24. <hi>For I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and ſaid; Take, eat, this is my body broken for you; this do in remembrance of me; And after the ſame manner he took the Cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:123663:32"/> therefore a duty for his people to be found in often.</p>
                  <p>But it being ſomewhat beſides the buſineſs in hand, to treat in particular of all the uſes and ends of this bleſſed inſtitution, my work here is to be inſtrumental, if the Lord will, to deter believers upon ſome offences that they have taken, from the neglect of this duty that is weighty, and not to be omitted or abuſed, as they will anſwer Chriſt Jeſus, who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take an account; it being that Ordinance that doth in a moſt lively manner expreſs the certainty of his ſuffering, in his body being broken, and his blood poured out, that he might finiſh the work of mans redemption, and remain at the Fathers right Hand, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus; againſt all the oppoſition of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Spirit, that ſeeks in our dayes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage and extinguiſh this bleſſed Ordinance, thereby to root out of mens underſtandings the certainty of Chriſt Jeſus being a perſonal fleſhly ſubſtance; and ſo converting into a Spirit, contrary to this ſaying of his, after his reſurrection; <hi>Behold my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:123663:33"/> ſad conſequence of the contrary, for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt Jeſus to be a fleſhly ſubſtance, and converting him into a Spirit, any Spirit, or every Spirit, and ſo in truth deny the Chriſt of God; And then blind, injudicious men, may form to themſelves, and world, what they will fancy to call their Chriſt: This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I ſhall now ſpeak of offences what they are, and what offences are not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Offences.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Offences given and taken, are ſuch, as when Nations, or Perſons when not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by invaſion to defend, yet by invade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others will offend; now they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend defending; here Offences are given and taken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Offences given and not taken, when we bleſs them that curſe us; do good to them that do hurt to us; pray for them that deſpightfully uſe us.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:123663:33"/> or at his ſecond coming, proved a ſeeming cauſe, was no real cauſe for the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at him; his viſage was marred more than any mans, when they looked for him to come, and preſently reſtore <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now ſuch Offences taken and not given, is the intent of this ſixt Sign, under the terme Small; ſo that when perſons give way to their paſſions, and are ſo moved at ſomething which ſeems to be a juſt Offence to them, from brethren or any other, without or before they had du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, not ſuſpending all kind of diſlike, till in the ballance they have tryed whether it be really an Offence, or but ſeemingly ſo; is a ſign of great weakneſs, proving that ſuch are under ſome ſpiritual decay, marked out, though upon another account, by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. <hi>But he that received the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: but when tribulation, and perſecution ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; becauſe of the word, by and by be is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Now perſecution and tribulation is no real cauſe of Offences, but rather an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to hold faſt the word, being one common mark ſuch are in the truth; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes it an argument of this kind, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>For this cauſe when I could no longer forbear, I ſent to know your</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:123663:34"/> 
                     <hi>faith, leaſt by ſome means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. We would have no man moved by theſe afflictions, for your ſelves know, we are appointed thereto;</hi> and inſtead of being offended we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to glory in tribulation: this may teach us to bemoan ſuch, and beg them be warn'd not to keep themſelves from Chriſts Table, becauſe of this or that ſeeming, or real miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in others, if in order to their reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it, we have done our duty.</p>
                  <p>For any therefore to eſtrange themſelves from Chriſts Table, it being no leſs than a refuſing the food he hath prepared; becauſe things go not juſt as they would have them, doth greatly argue the ſtop to be in themſeves though not by ſuch heeded; they being great wanderers abroad into the wayes of others; perhaps more buſying themſelves than they ought, and yet as great ſtrangers at home to ſelf-examination, and due perſonal preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which where ever it is, is that indeed that ſo warrantably cals perſons to come to Chriſt Jeſus Feaſt, of Bread and Wine, purchaſed with his blood; that negligence therein will prove no leſs than their great ſin: What is it therefore that ſhould keep us from that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein by faith we are to feed, as it were upon the fleſh of the Son of God?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:123663:34"/> 
                     <hi>Whoſe fleſh is meat indeed, and whoſe blood is drink indeed.</hi> Truly nothing but ſelf-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs or unpreparedneſs: Surely, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſpiritual growing Chriſtian, whoſe hungrings and thirſtings are after hourly communion with Jeſus Chriſt, can better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go his natural food a thouſand times, than yeild to a ſtop from this performance: Let us therefore examine our ſelves, that we are meet ſubjects, <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body, and ſo let us eat that Bread, and drink that Cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Cauſes of this decay, or yeilding upon ſmall Offences, to abſent from Chriſts Table; may be theſe three.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, Too great Ignorance who are the Subjects Chriſt calls to this Service.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Too too great aptneſs to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily provoked.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, Want of Love to Jeſus Chriſt, the Author of this Service.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Too great Ignorance; who are the Subjects Chriſt calls to this Service; which conſiſts in a miſconſtruing his general invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all penitent, believing, baptized Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who have had an orderly admittance thus far, and by way of Precept, are injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both, to come to this Service, and continue in it; <hi>The ſame day were added to the Church</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:123663:35"/> 
                     <hi>three thouſand ſouls, and they continued ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the Apoſtles doctrine, fellowſhip, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread and prayer:</hi> it is peculiarly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch appointed and ſanctified, that they may keep in remembrance their Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>So often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> But I would not be miſtaken here, as that I mean, the outward badge of theſe only, makes right Subjects for Chriſts Call; yet this outward muſt be, but wo to it when it is alone: The Kings daughter is to be all glorious within, as well as her garment of pure gold: The hungerer and thirſter after his ſupply, that ſenſibly ſees all his ſprings to be in him; and as the Hart panteth after the brooks of water, hath his foul crying, Oh when ſhall I come and appear before him? negligence to be thus fitted, cauſeth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſts Call.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Too too great aptneſs to be eaſily provoked: Some Chriſtians are ſo weak, that they will be ſtill forming diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to themſelves, ill interpreting others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſtraining at every Gnat, which generally comes through weakneſs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unaptneſs to be buſying themſelves with their high Calling, &amp; the worth of Gods gracious priviledges afforded them; by which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:123663:35"/> means the inward man is too much raked or made raw, and ſo apt to ſmart at every little touch; as ſpecial care therefore muſt be had in Churches, that none give juſt offence; ſo that none upon too light account take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; for it doth but argue ſuch Children or Babes in Chriſtianity, and greatly robs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that ſpiritual refreſhing ſtrength, that otherwiſe might be their preſent portion, and fills their heart with diſquieting thoughts to the hindring their ſpiritual appetite from taking in that rich refreſhment, Chriſt Jeſus Table is furniſht with for every prepared gueſt.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, Want of love to Jeſus Chriſt, the Author of this Service: All thoſe motives that provokes the heart to love Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould be active now; <hi>viz.</hi> The greatneſs of his love to purchaſe this Service for us, with no leſs price than his precious blood; the ſmalneſs of our deſert to procure this; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the high priviledges it ſignifies us heirs unto: <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed on as, that we ſhould be called,</hi> (or accounted) <hi>the Sons of God, who was before without Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But now made nigh through the blood of Chriſt.</hi> How ſhould this provoke our fervent love to him, to be crying out with the Spouſe in the Canticles;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:123663:36"/> 
                     <hi>My beloved is fair and ruddy, the chiefeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ten thouſand.</hi> Certainly my friends, were our hearts truly ſpiritual, we could not chuſe but ſee ſingular deſert in Jeſus Chriſt; calling for the greateſt of our love, in a holy affection to the in joying of him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us prefer our communion with him, in this ſervice, before all things that in this world may challenge our deareſt reſpect: It muſt needs therefore follow, that want of love, makes way for ſmall offences to keep us from Chriſts Table; I ſhall leave this to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and paſs to the Seventh Sign of a dying Chriſtian.</p>

                  <p>For the firſt, Exod. 17. 11. <hi>And it came to paſs, when</hi> Moſes <hi>held up his hands,</hi> Iſrael <hi>prevailed; and when he let down his hands, the</hi> Amalekites <hi>prevailed,</hi> Joſh. 10. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Then ſpake</hi> Joſhua <hi>(or prayed to the Lord,) in the day when the Lord delivered up the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites, <hi>before the Children of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and he ſaid in the ſight of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Sun ſtand thou ſtill upon</hi> Gibeon; <hi>and thou Moon upon the Valley of</hi> Jaalon; <hi>and the Sun ſtood ſtill, and the Moon ſtayed until the people had avenged themſelves upon their enemies; and there was no day like</hi>

                     <hi>that before it, or after it, that the Lord heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the prayer of a man, for the Lord fought for</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Prayers Excellency appears in this, it holds with holy reverence Gods hands, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I have ſeen this people, and behold it is a ſtiff-necked people; Now therefore let me alone that I may deſtroy them, and I will make of thee a great Nation. And</hi> Moſes <hi>beſought the Lord, ſaying, Lord why doth thy wrath wax hot, turn I pray thee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of this evil againſt them,</hi> Numb. 14. 11, 22. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>how long will this people provoke me, and how long will it be ere they believe me? now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me alone that I may deſtroy them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Prayers Excellency appears, in that in no condition we can be barred from it, <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the Lyons Den, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales Belly, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Then</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah <hi>prayed to the Lord his God, out of the Fiſhes Belly, and ſaid, I cryed by reaſon of my affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me: out of the belly of Hell cryed I, and thou heardeſt my voyce:</hi> ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in priſon prayed, and ſang praiſes to God, and the priſoners heard them.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to Lets to prayer, <hi>i. e.</hi> what
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:123663:38"/> hinders Prayer from prevailing with God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, preſumption in an unreverent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing before the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. and 20. 33. &amp;c. <hi>For as yet the people had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their heart unto the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, therefore thus will I do unto thee O</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God O</hi> Iſrael, Amos 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Let or hinderence to Prayer is, wandering thoughts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou maiſt be ſaved, how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Therefore take no thought ſaying, what ſhall we eat, or what ſhall we drink; or wherewith ſhall we be cloathed? but ſeek ye firſt the Kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32, 33.</p>
                  <p>The third Let to Prayer is, boſome ſin, or pleaſant delight in ſome ſecret luſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 8. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me.</hi> Joſh. 7. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>The Lord ſaith to</hi> Joſhua, <hi>get thee up, wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face;</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they have alſo tranſgreſſed my covenant, which I have commanded them; for they have taken of the accurſed thing, and have alſo ſtolen and diſſembled; and they have put it</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:123663:38"/> 
                     <hi>alſo among their own ſtuff, therefore they could not ſtand before their Enemies, but turned their backs.</hi> This good man <hi>Joſhua</hi> in Chap. 10. 12. at another time is ſo prevalent at Prayer, that the Sun and Moon ſtands ſtill; yet now in his ſeventh Chapter, becauſe there is ſome boſome ſin in the Camp, he cannot prevail till this is removed.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Let is, want of reconciliation to brethren, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23, 24. <hi>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee; leave there thy gift before the Altar, and firſt go and be reconciled to thy brother.</hi> Mat. 6. 12. <hi>For give us our debts as we forgive our debters; but if you forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive ye your treſpaſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fifth Let, is deſpairing doubts of being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>If any man lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let him ask it of God that giveth to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him; but let him ask in ſaith, nothing doubting, for he that wavereth, is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind, and toſſed; let not that man think he ſhal receive any thing at the hand of the Lord: whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, believe that you ſhall receive it, and ye ſhall receive it,</hi> Mark. 11. 24.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall now ſpeak of Helps to prayer;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:123663:39"/> or ſaith ſome, I would but I cannot pray, I want words, all that I can do is to ſigh; for a Help to this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, labour to get a feeling of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of Prayer, ſo as that thy heart goeth under a grievous burthen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſt not pray, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>O Lord are not thine eyes upon the truth, thou haſt ſtricken them but they are not grieved.</hi> Here the Prophet complains, that though <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſtricken, ſmitten, and afflicted, yet they have not grieved; clearly implying, that a grieved, burthened ſtate at the ſenſe of want, is a fair ſtep in the way to obtain ſupply, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4, 6. <hi>For mine iniquities are gone over my head, as a heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me; I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly; caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee,</hi> Pſal. 55. 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſtudy much how to get deep ſenſe of your great wants of Gods daily help; <hi>All my ſprings are in thee; without me you can do nothing: For in him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. 27. 28.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider God hath provided no way for you to acquaint him with your wants, but prayer, and if you cannot pray, how will you make your complaints to God,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:123663:39"/> 
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>In every thing by Prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzia ſought God in the dayes of Ezra, and as long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper: call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. Hoſ. 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider that all your outward mercies becomes bleſſings through Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>For every creature of God is good, if it be reeceived with thanksgiving, for it is ſanctified by the word of God and Prayer: Give us this day our daily bread; When Jeſus had made the multitude ſit down upon the ground, he looked up to Heaven, and gave thanks;</hi> or ſaid grace, as the old tranſlations read it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider what a miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will yours be, if caſt into the Lyons Den, Whales Belly, or ſtocks, if you cannot pray: <hi>They poured out their ſupplications when thy chaſtening was upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Intreat Jeſus Chriſt to teach you to pray, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. <hi>And it came to paſs, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one of his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John alſo taught his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</hi> as the Lord commands us to do, ſo he muſt help us to Pray. <hi>Zech.</hi> 36. 37.</p>

                  <head>SIGN VIII. <hi>VVHen Reading and Meditation in the holy Scriptures, is not delightful but burthenſome unto you.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>When Iſrael was pleaſed to chuſe them a King, God is pleaſed to ſet him his work, leſt they loſe their end, and God loſe his honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when he ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Kingdome, that he ſhall write him a Copy of Gods Law in a book, and it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therain all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, that his heart he not lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up above his brethren.</hi> In like manner when <hi>Joſhua</hi> enters upon the Government, he hath this charge from God, that the Book of the Law ſhould not depart out of his mouth, but he muſt meditate therein day and night; that he might obſerve to do according to all thats written, then ſhould he make his way proſperous, and have good ſucceſs. And when
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:123663:40"/> King <hi>David</hi> declares who is the bleſſed man, He is one that delights in the Law of the Lord, making it his meditation day and night. This premiſed, diſcovers moſt pretious worth attainable through Scripture reading, with meditation; and if need were might call for a multitude more witneſſes, both from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Experience: But it being not ſo much my proper work to aſſert Scripture Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as to ſhow and prove that Chriſtian to be dying to Chriſt, that is not delightfully taken up with Meditation, and Reading in his Word. I ſhall therefore proceed in a plain method.</p>
                  <p>Thus where delight to Reading and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation grows low, there negligence to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and meditation muſt needs grow high, there decay grows great, &amp; ſuch muſt decline in their ſpiritual eſtate, this negligence bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it much ignorance, and ſo covers the eyes and hearts of ſuch as with a vail, ſo as that they cannot ſo ſee as the ſpiritual grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man ſees, Gods Precepts how they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, Gods promiſes how they uphold him, Gods threatnings how awfully they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, the Scripture being his Treaſury or Store-houſe, from whence he is made able through the ſpirits help, to withſtand the fiery darts of the wicked one, ſaying after Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus his Captain, thus and <hi>thus it is written.</hi> It is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:123663:41"/> evident to the meaneſt capacity, that doth but conſider, how great incapacity all ſuch muſt needs be in, to underſtand and reſiſt the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold temptations and wiles of the evil one, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be well acquainted with Gods holy Word, that hath in it Armour for the whole man, with directions how to put it on; and it becometh thus excellent, for that all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by the inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to all good works, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. Ignorance therefore here, muſt make ſore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and bring as I humbly conceive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſons, theſe ſix Calamities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It makes you in a wilderneſs when ſickneſs and affliction comes, becauſe you will not know how and why they come. Sickneſs, and Affliction are of two ſorts, inward and outward; Inward are ſuch as ſeize upon the mind, as a judgment cauſed upon the perſon where they come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>And he ſaid, go and tell this people, hear ye indeed but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not; ſee ye indeed, but perceive not; make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes; leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:123663:41"/> 
                     <hi>and be healed.</hi> So Rom. 1. 21, 28. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are not convenient. For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Now ſuch fore judgments as theſe, are come upon and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by many, who turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, profeſſing to be moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, live as the almoſt moſt carnal, little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (becauſe greatly ignorant) of thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cauſes they may run into, to the bringing upon themſelves ſuch ſpiritual judgments or ſickneſſes and afflictions as theſe. And indeed how comes it to paſs, that ſuch afflictions are not feared, before they come to the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch to walk ſo as may prevent their coming, but ignorance of the Scripture? they not converſing often with them, to the well informing themſelves, what judgments may come on their minds, and what are the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God aſſigns of their coming, ſo as to be in trembling and dread continually, to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:123663:42"/> themſelves out of that channel, where ſuch bitter waters runs.</p>
                  <p>Again, there are outward ſickneſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and they are ſuch as theſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 58, 59, 60. <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve to do all the words of this Law, that are written in this Book; that thou maiſt fear this glorious and fearful Name, the Lord thy God; Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues, and of long continuance; ſore ſickneſſes and of long continuance: Moreover, he will bring upon thee all the diſeaſes of Egypt, which thou was afraid of, and they ſhall cleave unto thee.</hi> Levit. 26. 15, 16. <hi>If ye ſhall deſpiſe my Statutes, or if your ſoul ſhall abhor my judgments, that you will not do them, but that you break my Covenant; I alſo will do this to you, I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven appoint over you Terror, Conſumption, and the burning Ague, that ſhall conſume the eyes, and cauſe ſorrow of heart; and ye ſhall ſow your ſeed in vain, for your Enemies ſhall eat it.</hi> But I ſhall ſpeak fully to the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Affliction in the Twenty ſecond <hi>Sign,</hi> and therefore proceed no further here, but come to the ſecond Calamity, that Scripture Ignorance brings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That your uneven walking with God, may bring upon your ſelves death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:123663:42"/> its time. This Particular is proved thus; Long life promiſed to the obedient, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the Land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Alſo Deut. 32. 46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts to all the words which I teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie among you this day; &amp; command them your Children, for it is not in vain, becauſe that through this thing,</hi> (mark that) <hi>ye ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long your dayes in the Land, whither ye go over into</hi> Jordan <hi>to poſſeſs it.</hi> This is alſo proved by the contrary which comes upon the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 16, 17. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aſide and ſerve other Gods, and then the Lords wrath be kindled againſt you, and ye periſh quickly from off the good Land, which the Lord giveth you.</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 13. <hi>But it ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his dayes, which are as a ſhadow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feareth not before God.</hi> So Chap. 7. 17. <hi>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou fooliſh, why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By means of Scripture Ignorance, you cannot know to ask in faith the things you want for ſoul or body; that is, you will not know where to be abſolute or poſitive in your asking, and whereto be ſubmiſſive and conditional in your asking: Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:123663:43"/> gives directions as to the putting up Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to God, and men may eaſily err by not obſerving them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 26. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> (to wit the Angel) <hi>Let me go for the day brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and he anſwered,</hi> (to wit Jacob) <hi>I will not Let thee go, except thou bleſs me.</hi> So Exod. 32. 12. <hi>Wherefore ſhould the Egyptians ſay, for miſchief did he bring them out to ſlay them in the Mountains, and to conſume them from the face of the earth; Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil againſt thy people.</hi> So Acts 12. 5. Peter <hi>therefore was kept in priſon, but prayer was made without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God for him.</hi> By theſe Scriptures we may obſerve, that to be conditional or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in our asking, when God may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by denying, is not good; therefore in this caſe, may a man coming in Gods way, be bold to ask pardon of his ſins, peace to his conſcience, power over his corruptions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition: in ſuch caſe, Gracious and humble reſolutions to have no denial, greatly liketh God, and ſuits with his will, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 6, 7. <hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon thy walls, O Jeruſalem, which ſhall never hold their peace day nor night; you that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence till he eſtabliſh and make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth.</hi> But obſerve, in all caſes Petitions putting up, muſt not thus
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:123663:43"/> be framed, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 14. <hi>And when he would not be perſwaded, we ceaſed ſaying, the will of the Lord be done.</hi> So Rom. 1. 9, 10 <hi>For God is my witneſs, whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son, that without ceaſing I make mention alwayes of you in my prayers; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king requeſt, if by any means I might now at length have a proſperous journey, by the will of God,</hi> (mark that) <hi>to come to you.</hi> So Jam. 4, 15. <hi>For that ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will, we ſhall live and do this or that:</hi> I ſhall leave this to conſideration, and proceed to the fourth Calamity.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Negligence to Reading and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, will make you ignorant wherein you may prevent the preſence and comforts of Gods holy Spirit; that is, that God may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take away his ſpirit from ſtriving with you, or you away from his ſpirit, <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. 1 Sam. 16. 14. <hi>But the ſpirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil ſpirit from the Lord troubled him.</hi> Pſal. 51. 7. <hi>Take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi> Neh. 9. 30. <hi>Yet many years didſt thou for bear them, and teſtifiedſt againſt them by thy ſpirit in thy Prophets, yet would they not give ear; Therefore gaveſt thou them into the hands of the people of the Land: But they rebelled and vexed his holy ſpirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:123663:44"/> 
                     <hi>was he turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> By theſe Scriptures we may ſee, that the holy Spirits company may be put away from us through ungracious wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Negligence in Scripture will make you ignorant, that there is a Legion of evil Angels waiting hourely to take advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; no ſooner in the Text but now mentioned, had the good Spirit left <hi>Saul,</hi> but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices:</hi> Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noting, how careful this good man was to keep the tempter at greateſt diſtance; while perſons are not ſenſible that they are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended with wicked Spirits, that ſeeks to inſnare them, by drawing them aſide from God, they ſhall be the oftner captivated, and ſo in their ſpiritual eſtate in great danger to be ſpoiled; <hi>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt, and findeth none; then he returns to his houſe,</hi> [or heart] <hi>from whence he came out, and finding it empty, ſwept,</hi> that is, deſtiture of the good Spirits company, <hi>then goeth he and takes with him ſeven more wicked Spirits than himſelf, and enters in and dwels there, Mat.</hi> 12. 43, 44.

                  <p>Sixthly, It makes you ignorant that you may hinder Gods holy Spirit from working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effectual good upon you. This may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that the good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Gods good Spirit upon any, may be by them hindered; but if it be conſidered well it need not be ſtrange, for if the workings of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:123663:45"/> the holy Spirit were unreſiſtable, then few if any could be ungodly; it ſtrove much with the old World, and yet they was not worthy to be ſaved from the Deluge; and ſtriving need not be where there can be no reſiſting. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the holy Spirit was much grieved with <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſtubbornneſs, teſtifying againſt them many years, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. yet would they not give ear; how could it be ſaid the Spirit griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their withſtanding, if they could not withſtand? <hi>Turn ye at my reproof, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you; and make known my words unto you, but ye have ſet at naught all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: In all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore</hi> (mark that) <hi>he was turned to be their enemy.</hi> Now if the workings and ſtrivings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, were unreſiſtable, certainly <hi>Iſrael</hi> with whom it ſo ſtrove, being ſo bemoaned of God for their rebellion, neither could nor ſhould have ſo withſtood him. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up O</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how ſhall I deliver thee O</hi> Iſrael? <hi>how ſhall I make thee as</hi> Adma <hi>or</hi> Zeboim? <hi>my heart is hot within me, my repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are kindled together:</hi> Would it not be blaſphemy to ſay, that Gods thus bemoaning was not real? It is altogether certain, that

                  </head>
                  <p>This Sign is too too common amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and commonly ariſeth from ſome diſlike that they take, becauſe things go not juſt as they would have them, after the light of their own eyes; ſuch may know themſelves, or at leaſt be known by their inſtability or running from one thing to another; as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, given to change, no longer conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than while they are proſecuting ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other, that hath in it the face of new, and if with their notion they prove to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, then perhaps quieted for a while, till ſome other new conceit take them; but if not accepted, then they ſwell ſo big, that the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:123663:46"/> bounds of the Church is too ſtrait to hold them. And ſure from hence hath riſen the multitude of dividings in opinion, that now are on foot in our Land, men growing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently conceited that they are in the right, and no reaſon ſhall ſway them; but if their offer be rejected, then preſently they make a ſchiſme, and ſo ſtriving to get a party, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of great injuſtice, as though truth were only in them, and withſtood becauſe their Notion is withſtood. All this while the great end of Church-being, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appointing <hi>(to wit edification)</hi> not ſo much as thought of, but forgetting that bleſſed rule of Chriſt Jeſus beſt followers (who became all things to all men that they might gain the more) drive on furiouſly, and come what will come in the iſſue, all muſt preſently be as they ſee, or elſe they will be gone; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God knows if they were narrowly looked into, they would be found of the ſimple that are apt to believe every word, while the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent looks well to his goings, not haſty to receive, nor haſty to forgo what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received.</p>
                  <p>By this I would not be underſtood to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate men, who count others giddy headed for leaving an old Romiſh form, when by God they are otherwiſe perſwaded, light
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:123663:46"/> breaking in, and truth being made manifeſt; but I rather indeed would by this give ſuch to underſtand, that the drift of what is here poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, hath reſpect to ſuch as in a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Church cannot be contented; Not in the leaſt incouraging any others to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with falſe ſettlement, ignorantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that if they change, it will be to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new and not true. Men may change but it muſt be for the better, yet how apt are perſons to be affected with changes, that they will change though it be for the worſt; At ſuch a ſort of people my drift is, it being an evil that the Scripture is not wanting to tell us of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. in the beginning, <hi>While</hi> Moſes <hi>is but abſent for a while from</hi> Iſrael, <hi>they cry to</hi> Aaron <hi>to make them new Gods, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, theſe be thy Gods O</hi> Iſrael; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you may read, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 6. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 21. 5. Gods own appointment that once was welcome to them, now they loath it, while it remans the ſame from Gods own continued inſtitution, yet they are a weary of it, calling it light bread: An unſetled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taken with new things becauſe new, and a weary of this though true bread. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 13. 8, 9 ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke ſuch a Spirit as this, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever; Be not</hi>

                  <p>As a help therefore againſt this diſeaſe, I would humbly offer three or four directions, &amp; ſo conclude this Sign.</p>
                  <p>1 That you would pray often for Gods lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before ye take upon you his Religion.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>That is, When the knowledge of others ſinning, proves not thy ſorrowing; where the name and honour of God lies near a heart, a deep wound muſt needs come at the tydings of miſcarriage, and by this moſt certainly may a growing or declining Chriſtian be read, and read himſelf if heeded; for anſwerable to the ſpiritual ſenſe or feeling of things, will their behaviour be. A man that is wounded in his body, is more or leſs aſtoniſhed at it, and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by it, as he more or leſs retains his ſenſes; want whereof leſſens not the wound, it rather ſhews the danger of ſuch to be the greater: Three or four things conſidered muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:123663:48"/> and prove ſuch Chriſtians not only dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but near dead, as can hear of others ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by no means they themſelves toucht with ſorrowing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the great diſhonour that ſin brings to God; the ſin of no people diſhonours God ſo much as the ſin of profeſſors, <hi>You have I known of all the Families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities,</hi> Amos 3. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The great reproach it brings upon the Goſpel; A man that never profeſt any thing better than making it his trade to ſin, though his eſtate be miſerable, yet he profeſſes not better; but for ſuch as take upon them the name or profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and not depart from, or again turn to iniquity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the enemies of God to blaſpheme, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The lamentable miſery that ſuch bring upon themſelves; There is more hope of one that never made any profeſſion; the ſin of this is next door to impoſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from final hardning, <hi>It had been better they had never known the way of truth, then after depart from the holy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 2 Pet. 21. 4. The evil World by ſeeing ſuch ſin, are not only tempted to remain in their ſinful ſtate, but to glory in it, for they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:123663:48"/> may think they do but ſin, and ſerve, and pleaſe themſelves; &amp; if profeſſors ſo do, why may not they? Thus the Devil ſecretly laughs at them, &amp; openly gets advantage by them; <hi>Wherefore the ſin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord. Elies</hi> Sons that was in the Prieſt-hood, is ſingled out with marks of Gods diſpleaſure, as ſinners of a deep dye, inſomuch that want of ſuitable indignation againſt them for their evil in their Father <hi>Eli,</hi> who in other things was a good man, brings upon him that, that makes the ears of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> that heard of it to tingle, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 3, 4. What a plague was brought upon thoſe that did evil before the Lord in <hi>Moſes</hi> time? twenty four thouſand ſlain til <hi>Phineas</hi> in his zeal to the Lord ſtood up and made an attonement, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, that the Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, were as to the act more wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, as to the ſame and ſuch like wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet we do not read of ſuch ſeverity in God towards them, as to thoſe his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had ſeen his miracles, and his wonders; were it not that I feared the wrath of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, leſt their adverſaries ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrangely, and ſay our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done this, I would ſcatter my people among the Nations, but for tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:123663:49"/> the wicked to do more wickedly: Gods ſeverity ſhould be ſet out againſt his own people in bitter characters; this muſt needs render ſuch very much dying to Chriſt, that can hear of ſoul miſcariages in other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and not themſelves taken with horrour and aſtoniſhment; <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart, becauſe thou haſt heard, Oh my ſoul in Jeruſalem, the ſound of the Trumpet, the Alarm of War; Set a mark upon the fore-heads of the men that ſigh and weep for the abominations that are done in the midſt thereof;</hi> Zekiel. 9. 4. <hi>I will gather them that are ſorrowful for the ſolemn aſſemblies, who are of thee, to whom the reprobate is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> Zeph. 3. 18. Doth not the Scrptures with one conſent, diſcribe the growing, &amp; declining Chriſtian by this very mark? one is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the other mourns not; it is reported there is fornication amongſt you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: clearly noting, that this was none of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but indeed an evident token of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al loſs in them, the contrary being ſo honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Gods account, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſorrowful ſpirit at others miſdoings; plainly proving, that if a wanting, a certain character of great decay: I ſhall come now to offer briefly ſome Cauſes of this ſpiritual decay, and ſome Remedies to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:123663:49"/> remove or prevent it, and ſo conclude this Sign.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, want of zeal, that burning ſhining Grace, which when accompanied with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot bear to ſee or hear of Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in others, without perſonal horror; <hi>As ſoon as</hi> Moſes <hi>came nigh the Camp, and ſaw the Calf, and dancing that was there, his anger waxed hot, and he took the Calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to pouder,</hi> Exod. 32. So <hi>Phineas</hi> in his zeal to the Lord, when he ſaw the evils that were committed in the Camp, aroſe and ſlew both the man and the woman, and ſo the plague was ſtaid.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, want of becoming love to others eternal welfare, is a Cauſe of our not ſorrowing at their ſinnings; that good man <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 13. 17. <hi>If they will not hear,</hi> (but perſiſt in their evil way) <hi>his ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for their pride.</hi> See this alſo in Jeſus Chriſt, that had ſuch love to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing Jeruſalem, <hi>That when he was come near and be held the City, he wept over it,</hi> Luke 19. 41.</p>
                  <p>As Remedies againſt this decay; Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a wide breach it makes in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate, and whither in a little time, it will bring us; <hi>Repent, or elſe I will come unto</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:123663:50"/> 
                     <hi>thee quickly, and will ſight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth,</hi> Revel. 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In order to removing this, do as men do that have a deſperate mortal diſeaſe growing upon them, if not ſpeedily remedied; how will they go and run, pray and pay, leave no ſtone unturned, no means unattempted? Even in like ſort, muſt ſpiritual diſeaſes be looked at, and laboured with: <hi>Seeſt thou a man diligent, he ſhall ſtand before Kings and not mean men,</hi> Prov. 22. laſt. <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin,</hi> Pſal 51. 2.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Cauſe is, Unskilfulneſs in one great point of Chriſtianity; <hi>viz.</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſelf-denial, which ſtands in a conforming the whole man to be alwayes pleaſing and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord; ſuch knowing themſelves not to be their own but bought with a price, and therefore whether eating, drinking, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, walking, to be doing all to the glory of God, whoſe they are: Now unskilfulneſs herein, will be ſtill carrying on all affairs with much mixture; partly in deſigning the Lord, partly deſigning ſelf; having not ſo learned to live upon anothers bottome, as the Goſpel grace of ſelf-denial teacheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24, 25. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 34, 35. by which means many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:123663:52"/> are at a great ſtand how to ſpend this and that opportunity, and ſo inſtead of asking their fellow Chriſtian how he grows or ſtands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the beſt things, what temptations are upon him? when, at what times he findes himſelf moſt weak and unable to reſiſt? And whether often in cloſet prayer, watchings, faſtings? and what aſſurance he hath from ſome ſolid marks, whether he grows yea or nay? and what value he puts on fellowſhip with God, and injoying the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? what all this is, and what its worth, when it ſhines, when its clouded? but if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuch Communings as theſe, time be vainly ſpent in hearing and telling ſome new thing, complaining rather of hard times, than hard hearts, this and the other outward loſs, inſtead of true loſing; if the caſe be thus it muſt needs proclaim you dying Chriſtians; for that in your comings together, your talk is not ſavoury and heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third Cauſe may be this, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to a plain duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25. <hi>And let us conſider one another, to provoke to love, and to good works; not forſaking the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhort one another dayly, while it is called to day;</hi> that is certainly, to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing the work of the day) <hi>and ſo much</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Proving <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npreparedneſs to hear the Word of God, a Sign of Dying to Chriſt; with three ſorts of Hindrances, which muſt be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and what muſt be our work; before Hearing, in Hearing, and after Hearing.</head>
               <div n="12" type="sign">
                  <head>SIGN. XII. <hi>VVHen you are ſo little prepared for the ſolemn Aſſemblies, that they come before you think of them, or long for them.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>When Perſons ſuffers themſelves, to be ſo taken up with common or worldly buſineſs, as that they leave no room for ſolemn Prayer, and Preparation, to meet in Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at dayes appointed; its an evident token, of little reverence beſetting the heart, and as little conſideration who they are to meet: Now to come before the Lord in his Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, where he is wont to be, and hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be, there doubtleſs remains a work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to be done by us, by way of <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and that becauſe of Gods preſence being there, as in the Temple, the Type of Gods Aſſembly or Goſpel Church, <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 3, 9. <hi>I will put my Name there, and my heart, and my eyes, ſhall be there perpetually;</hi> his power,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:123663:54"/> preſence, and goodneſs ſhall be there, and he ever was and is wont to meet his People there. <hi>Tell me O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt and makeſt thy flocks to reſt at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if thou knoweſt not, go thy way and feed thy Kids by the ſhepheards tents,</hi> Cant. 1. Now that great preparation as to this and that by way of duty ought to be, will appear by what may follow; want to prepare therefore muſt needs be a character of ſpiritual decay; and the rather if we conſider, how ſtrict the Lord was as to them that drew nigh him when he gave out the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19, 10. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, go and ſanctifie the people to day and to morrow, and let them waſh their cloaths; and let the Prieſts alſo which come near to the Lord, ſanctifie themſelves, leſt the Lord break forth upon them. Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for not ſanctifying the Lord when they drew nigh him, <hi>there went out a fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> Levit. 10. 2. Moſt remarkable is that paſſage in good <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 41. 14. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will come into the Kings preſence, <hi>he ſhaves himſelf, &amp; changeth his rayment;</hi> layeth aſide his priſon garments: How much rather ſhould thoſe prepare and lay aſide, that come into the preſence of the King of Kings: <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his</hi>

                     <hi>word,</hi> Iſa. 66. 5. Perſons may hear from day to day, and remain much like the ſame, rather worſe than better; which muſt needs argue ſome defect in themſelves by unduly approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching near ſo ſolemn a Service: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in humility offer ſome Directions, what we may do in order to our profit, before hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in hearing, and after hearing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Before Hearing, pray God bleſs his Word unto you, and lead you in his way, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. 4, 5. <hi>Shew me thy way O Lord, teach me thy path, lead me in thy truth; Teach me for thou art the God of my ſalvation, on thee do I wait all the day,</hi> Exod. 33. 15. <hi>If thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</hi> This is as true in one caſe as another.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Go to the Aſſembly with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſiderations, that you are to meet God, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael, and becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael. King</hi> Rehoboam <hi>did evil, becauſe he prepared not his heart to ſeek the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 12. 14. compared with Chap. 19. 3. <hi>There are good things found in thee, in that thou prepareſt thy heart to ſeek God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Before you go to hear, you muſt lay aſide all ſuperfluity, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying aſide all filthineſs and ſuperfluity</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:123663:55"/> 
                     <hi>of naughtineſs, receive with meekneſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Superfluities to be laid aſide, which elſe will hinder you from profitting.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All thoſe doubtful carping cares for the things of this life, you are incident to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You muſt lay aſide all thoſe vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious frets of this life you are incident to, <hi>Judges</hi> 16. 16. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You muſt lay aſide all thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant pleaſing pleaſures of this life you are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10; 11. All or any of theſe being carried with us, and heeded by us, will ſo load us, that there will be no room for the Word to profit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When you come to hear, come with hungring and thirſting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Direction as to Hearing is, what you muſt do in the time of Hearing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, You muſt hear with reverence as Gods Embaſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. compared with 89. 7. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence by all that are about him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, You muſt hear as Gods Word, <hi>Iſa</hi> 66, 2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:123663:55"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, You muſt hear with attention and godly fear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 29. 48. <hi>And all the people were very attentive to hear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In Hearing, you muſt mix what you hear with faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>But the word preached did not profit, it being not mixt with faith in them that heard it,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 26.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, You muſt receive what you hear in the love of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 97.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, You muſt hear with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to obey, <hi>Deut</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>Now what muſt you do after Hearing?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, You muſt remember what ye have heard, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Secondly, That you may remember, you muſt meditate upon it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. Thirdly, of all the Sermons you hear, pick out ſomething moſt profitable, and confer about it, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 10. Fourthly, You muſt put into practiſe what you hear, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now hint three Reaſons of this great Care thus to Aſſemble and hear Gods word, and then proceed to the Thirteenth <hi>Sign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is the great Ordinance of Converſion. Secondly, The means of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans growth, and Sanctification. Thirdly, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in it, a great aggravation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnaton.</p>

                  <head>SIGN. XIII. <hi>VVHen you come to the Aſſembly, more for fear of brethrens eye, than Chriſts eye.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>That is, you are ſo indifferent as to coming, that would none miſs you nor queſtion you for it, you could well diſpence with abſence, and that without any material hinderance; 'tis much to be feared that this decay prevails ſtrongly with many profeſſors, who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hungring, or thirſtingat leaſt, at that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rate they once had, and ſtill doubtleſs ought to have, were they not loſing their reliſh to Ordinances, and the fellowſhip that they have had with God through them; for now they begin to ceaſe looking at things with an eye of faith, and have all or moſt of their recourſe to things after an eye of carnal ſenſe; and ſo no fear holds them to the outward order of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:123663:56"/> Gods Houſe; but what is taught by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of men; and were they not lyable to cenſures both from the aſſembly and others, (who have taken notice of their being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors) could as to the eye &amp; cenſure of Jeſus Chriſt quit all; wherefore the Lord ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 4, 13. <hi>For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me;</hi> [note that] it is far to many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees alienated, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men; it is from hence very evident, that they though they did come together, yet it was not from aright principle, their perſon, and their heart was aſunder, and God is pleaſed to note them out as people fearing him only with an outſide fear; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will proceed to do a marvellous work upon them; the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 30, 31. meets with ſuch a people, as are ſtill a quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Prophets words, and talking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in the doors of their houſes; yet would ſay, <hi>Come I pray and hear, what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord, coming as his people come, ſit before him as his people do, hear his word, and with their mouth ſhew much love; but their heart runs after covetouſneſs.</hi> So in the time of the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 3. there you have a deſcription of a decaying, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:123663:57"/> growing profeſſor; one is ſo weary, that they are ready to throw all profeſſion off, crying, <hi>It is in vain to ſerve the Lord, and what profit is it that we keep his Ordinances?</hi> at the ſame time thoſe truly ſpiritual, that feared Gods eye more than mans, <hi>they ſpake the oftner one to another, fearing him and thinking upon his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall give two or three deſcriptions, how ſuch may know themſelves, or be known; and ſo paſs to the next Sign.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such when by more or leſs weighty occaſions, they are hindered from the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, you will not find them troubled; whereas a truly growing Chriſtian, though hindered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God, yet he is thirſting, hungering, and thinks it long, ſaying with <hi>David, O when ſhall I come and appear before thee, Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such may be known, and know themſelves by this, they are of all others moſt apt to be diſcontented, it is ſeldome but one thing, or other troubles them, and goes not as they would have it; whereas the more ſpiritual, dwells ſo much in charity with every one, that they are ready to conſtrue every thing to the beſt; ſo neither much troubling, nor much troubled.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If any Schiſme or faction riſe, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:123663:57"/> cloſe with it, and ſo zealous for a while as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but it holds not long.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you ſhall find ſuch very forward at propagating ſome leſſer matters of Gods Law, while the more weighty they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves live ſtrangers to; a chief cauſe of all this is.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, large zeal, but ſhallow judgment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a too much prying into the wayes of others, and too little into their own.</p>

               <div n="14" type="sign">
                  <head>SIGN XIV. <hi>VVHen the decay in Chriſts Houſe, leſs troubles you than the decay in your own Houſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>This decay wherever found, notes a man very far gone on the dying hand; If trade de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, then nothing but complaining, if loſs by fire or ſickneſs, or death, then all is out of order, it breaketh their reſt, they cannot ſleep by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:123663:58"/> night, diſturbs their worſhips, they cannot pray, read, or meditate by day; It is evident with ſuch, the affaires of their own houſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nearer their heart, than the affairs of Chriſts Houſe, far from a truly growing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who is all out of order when it goeth not well with the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Now by decay here in the Sign, I would be underſtood of perſons in Chriſt Jeſus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who dye in their zeal, love, and fear, &amp;c. that begin to walk faintly after Chriſt Jeſus, flat to prayer, to reading, to hearing, cold and careleſs to ſpiritual viſitings one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſeldome and little in ſpiritual talk, when they meet together, not now as once, make it their trade &amp; buſineſs to be making the name of Chriſt great wherever they come; but either ſay nothing, or that that comes to nothing, having no ſpirit or ſavour in it; yet once was early at the Ordinances, quickly troubled if things went amiſs, much joyed when all werein a holy Harmony; but now being diſcovered to have loſt moſt of their ſpiritual reliſh to thoſe good things they once flouriſhed in, and this not working trouble of heart on fellow brethren, and beholders, muſt needs argue great decay.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch decay in Chriſts Houſe, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe in his ſpiritual profeſſion, hath
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:123663:58"/> been, and too too much is very evident both from Scripture and experience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. begining. <hi>And I Brethren could not ſpeak to you as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, but as to carnal, even babes in Chriſt, whereas there is among you envy, diviſion, and ſtrife, are ye not carnal and walk as men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, this ſame people as the firſt Chapter makes appear, had ſuch grace from God given by Chriſt Jeſus, that they were <hi>enricht in all utterance, and in all knowledge; ſo that they came behind other Chruches in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again this holy Apoſtle, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. Complains greatly of their decay; many had <hi>ſinned, and had not repented of the fornication, and uncleanneſs they had committed.</hi> From whence it is very obſeveable, that their decay was ſuch, that their <hi rend="blackletterType">Senſes</hi> or <hi rend="blackletterType">Feeling</hi> were well nigh departed from them, they were guilty of high crimes, among which were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, envyings, wrath, ſtrife, backbiting, whiſpering, ſwelling tumults;</hi> yet not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled among themſelves for all this: In like manner the <hi>Galathian</hi> Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Although affliction cometh not forth out of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble, as the ſparks fly upward,</hi> Job 5. 6, 7. And though in general, it be a portion common to all, yet in eſpecial, &amp; moſt of all to Gods deareſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the worſt of men commonly being in the leaſt of troubles here. <hi>They are not in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men,</hi> Pſal. 73. Now this portion from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:123663:60"/> the Lord, for bleſſed ends to his people, though deſerved by them, and as needful as their food to them, yet it being that that bows their ſoul down greatly, ought to be attended with ſuitable compaſſion, from their fellow brethren, as a help provided of God, that they may bear it the better.</p>
                  <p>When trouble or afflictions of any kind from the Lord, are great upon ſome, it is an evident token of decay in ſuch, as have not a fellow-feeling towards them. <hi>Woe to them that are at eaſe in Zion, and lye upon beds of Ivory, ſtretching themſelves upon their coutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, drink their wine in bowls, and anoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with chief oyitments, but are not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the afflictions of Joſeph,</hi> in Amos 6. from the 1. to the 7. Some we may ſee there lived a careleſs life, feeding to the full, had even what heart could wiſh, felt not the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in perſon, that at the ſame time was their brethrens portion; yet are not grieved for the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but lived at the height of Joy, under their own fulneſs, and were not compaſſionately affected with others pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury: This hath been found among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, but ill taken from them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. We ſhall find that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in great diſtreſs, and begs their brother <hi>Edom</hi> (who knew all travail that had befallen them) to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:123663:61"/> let them paſs by his high way; but he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them no pitty, was fallen from that ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing Spirit that ought to be in him. God will not forget to take notice of this, and reckon for it; which proves that pitty in his people one to another, is Gods expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, for three tranſgreſſions of</hi> Edom, <hi>and for four, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof, becauſe he purſued his brother with the ſword, and caſt off all pitty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome may Object and ſay, ſhall we pitty thoſe, (though Gods own people) that have brought by their ſinning, what miſery is come upon them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, God expects this from his peoples enemies, how much rather from their friends, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 5, 6. <hi>Sit thou ſilent and get thee into darkneſs, O Daughter of the</hi> Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>for thou ſhalt no more be called the Lady of Kingdomes; I was wroth with my people, and gave them into thy hands, but thou didſt ſhow them no pitty, upon the ancient haſt thou very heavily laid thy yoak;</hi> For this cauſe they muſt get them into darkneſs, clearly noting, that though God for his peoples e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils do afflict &amp; trouble them, yet it is not at all either to warrant his people, or his peoples enemies, to add to the burthen he layeth upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:123663:61"/> them; but on the contrary calls for pitty, yet not pitty with their ſins, but ſuch pitty as may reduce them from their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in taking notice that they are in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, <hi>Remember O Lord what is become upon us, conſider and bebold our reproach.</hi> The Church counts it of tendency to her healing, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her affliction taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you muſt pitty them in helping them to underſtand the cauſe why it is come; <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>Wherefore doth the living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Pitty in provoking them to ſearch and try their wayes, and turn to the Lord their God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Pitty in helping them down; that is, laying the diſpleaſure of God before them to humble them; and when duly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to comfort them; leaſt ſuch ſhould be ſwallowed up with over much ſorrow; We may conclude this evil to be very commona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong profeſſors, and it may call upon them to a ſelf-examining, whether, and wherein they are under this ſpiritual decay; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, or preventing of which, I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer three or four things briefly, &amp; ſo conclude this Sign.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to conſider the precepts of this duty,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:123663:62"/> and from whom they come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10, 14. <hi>Be kindly affectionate one to another, with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, in honour prefering one another; Weep with them that weep; put on as the elect of God, bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, meekneſs, long ſuffering; who is afflicted, and I burn not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider the danger of being wanting here.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it makes us moſt unlike God; <hi>in all their afflictions he was afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It opens a door to let in upon us equal miſery, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Therefore ſhall they go into captivity, with the firſt that go cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and the banquit of them that ſtretch themſelves, ſhall be removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It leads the way to heart-hardning <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Oppreſs not the widdow, father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſtranger, nor poor; but they refuſed to hearken, and made their heart as an Adamant ſtone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Third help againſt this decay, is to be conſidering or laying to heart the condition of ſuch, thinking it might now be, and yet may be our own; <hi>you that are ſpiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering </hi>
                     <hi>thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted; bear ye one anothers burthens, and ſo fullfil the Law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6. beginning.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:123663:62"/>
                  <p> A Fourth help againſt this decay is, humbly and conſtantly to beg of God, a heart accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the new Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 11. compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and ſo, <hi>Teach me thy way O Lord, I will walk in thy truth, unite my heart to fear thy name: I will give you a heart of fleſh;</hi> or a tender heart, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27.</p>

                  <p>Three things may be obſervable as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of this Sign.</p>

Chap. 34. 6, 7. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>John</hi> 17. and <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how far if called, ought we to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for this Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Suffering</hi> is a word reduceable to three heads; all centring in man.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in eſtate, there he muſt ſuffer, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his goods ſpoiled, his bodily ſubſtance waſted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 35.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in body, by perſecutions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, bonds, and imprſonments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32, 33. chap. 11. 36.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In life, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 12. Now in what caſes may we be proved guilty of this dying Sign, as falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any or all theſe three heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If becauſe of our eſtate we comply with, or countenance any evil, or refuſe to confeſs any good, <hi>John</hi> 12. 42. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Nevertheleſs among the chief Rulers alſo,</hi>

                     <hi>many believed on him, but did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If becauſe of our bodies, to free them from ſufferings, we will comply with, or countenance any evil, or refuſe to confeſs any good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>But when tribulation or perſecution riſeth, becauſe of the word, by and by they are offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If becauſe of our lives to free them, we will comply with any evil, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to confeſs any good, contrary to <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17, 18. chap. 16. 16. Under all or any of theſe conſiderations, when profeſſors can hear the great Name diſhonoured, and by their ſilence ſuffer it to be betrayed, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident they are dying to the things of God. No man or woman in a Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but one time or another, are lyable to temptations of this kind; that is, to have the Name and credit of Chriſt and his Goſpel, come in competition with their ſufferings and diſparagements. And anſwerable to their weakneſs, or ſtrength, ſo ordinarily is their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to ſuffer, or to ſin; there may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered three or four Cauſes of this, which being heeded and avoyded, may prove as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt this decay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A ſlaviſh fear of men, and things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:123663:64"/> to this life; <hi>Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings;</hi> up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n this ſcore, either fearing men, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſing the things pertaining to this life, as <hi>John</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2. <hi>many believed but did not confeſs him, for fear of loſing their place in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue.</hi> It is much to be feared that with regard to this, many hear and bear to hear, ſee and bear to ſee, know and bear to know, that diſhonour contracted to the name of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, that otherwiſe they would not, and certainly ought not; <hi>Have no fellowſhip with unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them;</hi> that is, come not in company with them, yet if you muſt, then rebuke them; for any among their great friends, kindred, or any other, by whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have great gain, to bear with ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, blaſpheming, deriding at religion, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain communications, plainly argues a great ſlaviſh fear to have poſſeſſed them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another Cauſe of this, may be an impotent love; that is, your love to God proves weak or lame; <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſts out fear; becauſe fear hath torment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Unskilfulneſs in the Doctrine of ſelf-denyal, may prove a great Cauſe of this decay; <hi>Whoſoever doth not take up his Croſs</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:123663:64"/> 
                     <hi>and follow me, cannot be my Diſciple; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I go bound in the ſpirit to Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there, ſave that the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaying, bonds and afflictions abide me, but none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear to my ſelf, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A doubtful mind of Gods All-ſufficiency, and certainty, to make up what damage may come through our care to his name and credit, both in this life, and that to come; Gods All ſufficiency is never ſo ſeen, as in the time of greateſt ſcarcity, or under the higheſt ſtraits; <hi>Then ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lord;</hi> and as Gods ſufficiency is never ſo ſeen as then, in like manner he is never ſo obliged as then; When perſons are ſuffering (through his grace) for his name-ſake: <hi>They ſhall lay their hands on you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, and bring you before Rulers for my names-ſake; but I will give you a mouth, and wiſdome, which all your adverſaries ſhall not be able to gain-ſay,</hi> Luke 21. 12. 13.</p>

                  <p>It is not poſſible to live without offences giving, or taking, real or ſeeming; and ſuch is mans frailty in common, that even under ſmall provocations, they are apt to yield to too deep an impreſſion.

                  <p>Firſt, By ſmall Offences is meant, either ſmall with reſpect to the little occaſion that is given, perhaps but ſeemingly; or if real, yet ſo ſlender, as it would be wiſdome to wink at it, and but folly to be moved by it.</p>

By this means we make our quarrel Gods, whoſe vengeance is, and he will righteouſly repay; otherwiſe, that is, when impatience carries us into the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:123663:66"/> path of ſinning, we make the quarrel our own, and take Gods work from him, and ſo incur his diſpleaſure upon us: The good Lord give in wiſdome and ſtrength to Chriſtians here, under all provocations, whether great or ſmal, in Church or Family, from friend or enemy, that they <hi>let patience have its perfect work;</hi> rather to the ſuffering any wrong, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the leaſt ſin; how like our Head the Lord Jeſus would this declare us to be? <hi>Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; yet when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, threatned not,</hi> (took it moſt meekly) <hi>and committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall now come to two or three Cauſes of this Decay, which being obſerved and avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may alſo ſerve as Remedies againſt this decay or dying Sign.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, the firſt Cauſe is, want of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over our own ſpirits.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Too high eſteem of worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</item>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:123663:67"/>
                     <item> Thirdly, Cumbring our ſelves with any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Want of government o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our own ſpirit; that is, not being Lords over our own paſſions, having them at our Chriſtian beck, when to be angry, and to what degree; Ignorance of our bounds here, makes us Beaſt-like; <hi>I were envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have waſhed my heart in vain, and cleanſed my hands in innocency,</hi> Pſal. 73. <hi>So fooliſh and ignorant was I, even as a Beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. He that hath no </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Rule </hi>
                     <hi>over his own </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Spirit, </hi>
                     <hi>is like a City without walls and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down.</hi> Want of government over our own ſpirit, makes us as naked or deſolate, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortified City, whoſe walls are broken down, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 28.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Too high eſteem of worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; He that will hardly be moved at a bigger thing, will not eaſily be moved for a pin; All offences are a kind of loſs, being ſomething that croſſeth the grain of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; now anſwerable to the eſtimation we have more or leſs of our loſs, will our offence taking be; It is putting too high a value of earthly Injoyments, as Husband, Wife, Children, Houſe or Land, Gold or Silver, that makes us ſo impatient at their loſs or leaving; <hi>Set your</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:123663:68"/> 
                     <hi>affection,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, <hi>on things above, not on things below; The time is ſhort, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they that have Wives, be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 29. The Apoſtle would have them to carry about with them their outward Injoyments, as a Traveller car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his old Coat about with him, every day thinking to throw it of; and if he looſe it, or be robbed of it, doth not much trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he ſets little value upon it: Would Chriſtian Travellers ſeek to ſoar high in their affections, how little would this little little worldly pelf, ſeem to us in our getting or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third Cauſe of our Impatience, and a third Remedy againſt it is, to avoyd much cumbring our ſelves with any buſineſs; that is, a filling our hands too full, over-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our ſelves, taking more upon us than we are able to mannage with ſubmiſſion to better things, and ſo hinder meditation and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation about thoſe laſting things of heaven; which occaſions a freezing of the ſpirits, and ſo we ſin and fall at every little trouble that comes in our way; whereas a joyful ſpirit, that is inlarged and at liberty, <hi>Bears all things, believes all things, endures all things, is not</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:123663:68"/> 
                     <hi>eaſily provked,</hi> as 2 Cor. 13. at large ſhews: All this while a ſpirit cumbred is in bondage, and quickly fretted, like a ſcald head ſoon bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; <hi>Take heed leſt at any time your heart be over-charged,</hi> Luke 21. 34. <hi>I would have you be without carefulneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 32. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art troubled, and cumbreſt thy ſelf about many things;</hi> but <hi>Mary hath</hi> made <hi>choice,</hi> or buſied her ſelf <hi>about that good part that ſhall never be taken from her,</hi> Luke 10. laſt.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:123663:73"/> then none ſhall ſeem more apt and active than themſelves, and God that beſt knows this, greatly abhors this; and will chaſtiſe ſuch Chruches as are not careful to remove, and will alſo in due time, make ſuch perſons by one means or other, ſo manifeſt, that he that runs may read them; but as there are ſuch that will not like them that deal faithfully with them; even ſo, there are ſome that out of perſonal reſpect to ſuch, and for fear to loſe their favour; will not tell them ſo naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their ſores; but in love to their perſons ſpeak faintly of their ſins, and ſo hate their ſouls. In ſhew theſe are a mans greateſt friends, but in truth his greateſt enemies, witneſs the falſe Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 6. <hi>Shall I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Ramoth Gilead <hi>to battel, or ſhall I forbear? and they ſaid go up, for the Lord hath delivered it to thy hand.</hi> And when a Prophet of the Lord one <hi>Micaiah</hi> is called for, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. They would fain have ſeduced him to ſpeak good words, as they called it, that is, pleaſant promiſes, though they were lyes; Thus we may ſee the property of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that for an angel will cry up a perſon as if he were almoſt an Angel, it was even ſo in <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> time, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>They have heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hurt of the Daughter of my people ſlightly, crying, peace, peace, when there</hi>

                     <hi>was no peace.</hi> When God would not, nor righteouſly could not, ſpeak peace but war, becauſe of their miſdoings; yet theſe falſe Prophets make promiſes of peace to them; though in their ſins, that as God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> complains, Chap. 13. <hi>Sow pillows under arm-holes, for pieces of bread, &amp; handfuls of barly.</hi> Sparing what he would have deſtroyed, and deſtroying what he would have ſpared: it is a very great Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Church or people, to have ſuch amongſt them, as will ſpeak peace to any out of the way of peace; it is as bad a judgment upon thoſe perſons, that love not thoſe that ſpeak war to them, when their impenitency ſpeaks the ſame; yet of ſuch the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Am I therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> Doubtleſs theſe <hi>Galathians</hi> ſpeaks in their hearts as much, as others ſpeak of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos, Chap.</hi> 10. who ſay, <hi>The land is not able to bear his words;</hi> once this ſame Church, could have pulled out their eyes (if it had been poſſible) to have done this ſame Apoſtle good; Now counts him their enemy for telling them the truth; But I ſhall briefly ſpeak of two or three Cauſes of this Decay, which being avoyded, may ſerve as ſo many Remedies againſt this dying Sign.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:123663:74"/>
                  <p> Firſt, A firſt Cauſe is, ſhaking hands again with our old ſins, falling in love with what once we loathed: very burthenſome to <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>Moſes,</hi> when once they began to grow affected with the Fiſh, the Cucumbers, and the Mellons, that they had in <hi>Egypt;</hi> not only then good, plain dealing <hi>Moſes</hi> comes out of requeſt, but even Gods Manna, though Angels food, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 5, 6. <hi>We remember the Fiſh which we did eat in Egypt freely, the Cucumbers and the Mellons, and the Leeks, and the Onyons, and Garlick, but now our ſoul is dryed away, and there is nothing at all beſides this Manna before our eyes, and this we loath as light bread,</hi> chap. 21.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, a ſecond Cauſe may be this, a loſing the reliſh we once had to heavenly things, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Iremember thee, the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals: when thou wenteſt after me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown; then thou waſt holineſs to the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his increaſe; but now be aſtoniſhed Oh heavens at this, and be horribly affraid, yea very deſolate, ſaith the Lord; for my people have forſaken the Fountain of living waters, and hewn out to themſelves broken Ciſterns, that can hold no water. But I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love; Remember</hi>

                     <hi>therefore from whence thou art fallen, or elſe I will come and remove thy Candleſtick except thou repent,</hi> Revel. 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. A third Cauſe may be this, a too too much complying with the friendſhip of this World: which in its latitude is enmity with God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you,</hi> (or as the margin reads, drive you back) <hi>that you ſhould not obey the truth:</hi> (or hold on your way) <hi>This perſwaſion comes not of him that calleth you: If any come to me and hate not his Father, and his Mother, Wife, Children, Brothers, Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luke 14. 26.

                  </head>
                  <p>For the opening of this Sign.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is meant by troubles; it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that in it ſelf is not, nor cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; But ſomething that oppoſeth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the deſire and delight of the mind; and therefore in Scripture called a burthen; <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord and he ſhall ſuſtain thee;</hi> were trouble a matter of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and profit in it ſelf, there would not be that proper need of prayer, and calling for help from one that is ſtronger; So that as the word is univerſal in an ordinary caſe, it takes in thoſe cares, fears, and ſorrows in common, that we are dayly incident to, <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>Man</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:123663:76"/> 
                     <hi>is born to trouble, as the ſparks fly upward;</hi> That is, it is as natural for man to meet with trouble, as it is for the ſparks to fly upward; becauſe there is not that ordnary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition, but it hath its proper temptation; as I ſhall inſtance in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſaith the poor man, were I a rich man, how glad, how thankful, how contented ſhould I be? But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the rich, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Who can come after the King?</hi> I got me this, and this, yet all <hi>vanity and vexation of Spirit; and there is no profit under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Why no profit?</p>
                  <p>For theſe reaſons; firſt, he is very apt to be high minded, and that will dog him, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him; and as it is very hard for the poor to keep the wolf from his door, that is hunger and rags, even ſo the rich he is in danger of, and involved with trouble, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high minded;</hi> when a high mind in a ſtately Coach, &amp; a meek Chriſt on a poor Aſſes colt meet together, <hi>Herods</hi> Pallace, and Chriſts Manger; It is well now if the high mind do not rather die than ſtoop, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 5. 2. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Who is the </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Lord </hi>
                     <hi>that I ſhould obey him? </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">what God </hi>
                     <hi>is able to deliver you out of my hand?</hi> Here in their greatneſs,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:123663:76"/> they challange God, <hi>James</hi> 5. Do not rich men oppreſs you, and bring you before Rulers? Is it not their common practice to uſe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to oppreſs you, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>While the poor uſeth intreaty, the rich anſwereth roughly;</hi> Now God is pleaſed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh a ſtatute in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to prevent the evil of high mindedneſs, which the rich was inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, The rich hath the trouble of care, as well as the poor, differing only in this, it runneth in another Channel; <hi>For the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the rich, will not ſuffer him to ſleep;</hi> he is ſo beſet with fears of the robber, and cares how to ſecure, as holds his eyes, is as a diſeaſe upon him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 12. It is clear from experience alſo, for ſome rich are ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with troubles, that they wiſh as hope of deliverance, they had been poor; Thus much for the rich. Now the poor hath his troubles alſo, though of a contrary kind, for as the rich are apt to be too high, ſo the poor too low; <hi>Job</hi> 5. 15. <hi>But he ſaveth the poor from the mighty,</hi> that is, from being cruſhed by him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 7. <hi>He raiſeth the poor out of the duſt;</hi> they are ſo low, that God ſtands for them to uphold them, and keep them, leſt they ſinck.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the rich, his abundance will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:123663:77"/> not ſuffer him to ſleep; <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>So the deſtruction of the poor is his poverty;</hi> that is, it leads him to do that, that will deſtroy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 7. <hi>Leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain;</hi> Hunger, Cold, Fears, Cares, Poverty, and Oppreſſion, that is their portion.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe are common troubles, that are incident to every man, but more than ordnaty are ſuch as are not ſo common, that do not come every day, but are of ſuch a kind as this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble;</hi> This day of trouble notes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſingularity, as elſe-where the hour of temptation, notes ſomething not ordinary and common, for every man is ſubject to be tempted daily, but this is called hour of tryal, becauſe it is ſome temptation of a ſtrange kind, not ordinary &amp; common, as is evidenced by theſe Scriptures following, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 49. <hi>Nevertheleſs we made our prayer unto our God, Iſa.</hi> 37. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5. All theſe Texts plainly ſhew, that the practice of holy men, in more than ordinary troubles, was to be more than ordinary in prayer.</p>
                  <p>But it may be Objected, what is meant by ordinary prayer; whether once or twice a day, men ought in ordinary caſes to pray.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:123663:77"/>
                  <p> In Anſwer to which I ſhall firſt premiſe, that men ought to pray daily, in, or under ordinary or common troubles, from theſe Texts of Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7, 11. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi> this day, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſome particular day, in a mans life time, or elſe every day; that day that we have need of daily bread, or Gods ſtrength and help, is the day here intended; but every body will grant, that every day we have need of daily bread; therefore doubtleſs, the intent of Jeſus Chriſt here is, that we ſhould pray every day, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1, 5. <hi>Men ought alwayes to pray and not to faint,</hi> but <hi>cry day and night, Luke</hi> 21. 36. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 3. comp. with 88. 9. <hi>Hear me O Lord for I cry to thee daily;</hi> By this I hope all good men will conclude, that its their duty to pray every day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection,</hi> 2. How often every day in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes, ought we to pray?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw</hi> Where it hath not pleaſed God by way of precept, to direct to times by way of number, example doubtleſs may teach us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. <hi>Morning, noon, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will I pray and cry to God, and he will hear me;</hi> as if <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſay, my often impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning will be a means of prevailing, <hi>Daniel</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Kneeled down upon his knees, three times a day, and prayed, and praiſed God as he did</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:123663:78"/> 
                     <hi>afore time:</hi> clearly proving, it was <hi>Daniels</hi> practice to be in that heavenly ſervice, three times a day; theſe Scriptures compared with, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>(pray without ceaſing)</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurely, either that Chriſtians ought in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary troubles, to be found in prayer three times a day, or at leaſt to be all the day in a praying frame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 3. But ſome may ſay, what if we do not pray at all ſome dayes, ſhall we fare the worſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, if you pray not at all, you go out of Gods peoples road; as both precept and example ſeems to point out; <hi>Give us day by day our daily bread:</hi> ſeeming to note as well a continuance in the duty of asking, as in the need of receiving; alſo: <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. pray cotninually: <hi>Nehemiah, David, Daniel,</hi> and Jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Chriſt, by their daily practice ſeems to conſtrue this precept, to intend daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not to pray at all, ſeems to put us out of Gods gratious protection, and ſo we prove ſelf-betrayers, <hi>Zek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>I will yet for all this, be inquired of, by the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Luke 22. 40. <hi>Pray that you enter not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; if you ſeek him he will be found of you, but if you forſake him, he will forſake you, Chr.</hi> 15. 2.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:123663:78"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Not to pray at all, ſeems to put us out of the way of promiſe of being helped in troubles; <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50. <hi>Seek and you ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Neglect to prayer, tempts God to ſuffer us to be led into temptation; <hi>Pour out your hearts before him at all times; God is a refuge for us;</hi> but it is to ſuch as wait upon him, by pouring out their wants before him, <hi>Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil,</hi> Mat. 6.</p>
                  <p>What hath been ſaid, may teach two things; Firſt, the lamentable condition of ſuch as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor will pray, that are as unaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it, as the Heifer to the yoak; living ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Athieſts in the World; ſaying in their heart, if not in their actions too, <hi>there is no God: Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen, and families that call not upon thy name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This teacheth to ſtrengthen the hearts and hands of ſuch as fear God, to this ſervice of prayer, it being part of their defence or Armor, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Praying alwayes with all prayer, and ſuppliaction, in the ſpirit, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto with all perſeverance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When thou ſaideſt ſeek my face, my heart ſaid, thy face Lord will I ſeek: thou wilt hide me in thy</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>The more or leſs ſpiritual any man is, may be eaſily diſcovered under this Tryal; Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being of that piercing kind, that other tryals are not, becauſe of the great influence it hath upon the ſenſitive part of man, where ever it comes, while ſenſe remains, it makes the perſon reſtleſs, either to find out cauſe, or cure, or both. We may therefore firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the word Affliction, what that meaneth; to afflict, is to lay ſome burthen
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:123663:79"/> upon a perſon, that is not ordinary, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>There they ſhall afflict you four hundred years:</hi> this is opened in, Exod. 1. <hi>Iſrael is made to ſerve with rigor,</hi> Lam. 1. 4. 5. <hi>The wayes of Zion do mourn, becauſe none come to the ſolemn feaſts: all her gates are deſolate, her Prieſts ſigh, her virgins are afflicted, and ſhe is in bitterneſs. I have ſeen, I have ſeen the affliction of my people, which are in Egypt, by reaſon of his task-maſter,</hi> Acts 3. 34. By theſe Texts it appears, that affliction mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any grief or trouble, that cometh upon ſoul or body, name or eſtate, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, or the tryal of faith; ſo that ſickneſs, and diſeaſes, as feavor, and ague, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, inflamation, &amp; the like, are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under this word affliction; it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be neceſſary to open the word Spiritual cauſe, it being in the Sign opoſed to natural cure: by ſpiritual cauſe, is to be underſtood, ſome provoking God in the ſubject afflicted, to the procuring this affliction, nothing ſome cauſe or other, why the Spirit ſuffers it to come upon us.</p>
                  <p>Now every body will be ready to grant, that theſe things before promiſed, may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called affliction, but not grant that there can be ſuch a ſpiritual cauſe in themſelves, and ſo make the Sign of no force.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The firſt Objection is grounded upon, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>The Child that is born to thee ſhall ſurely die: David</hi> is threatned with death in the child that hath not offended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This act of God to take away <hi>Davids</hi> Child, if conſidered, will be found mercy mixt with juſtice, <hi>David</hi> by the Law was to die for the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> now God in reſpect he bare to <hi>David</hi> for what good he had done, and further were like to do, being a man ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods own heart, goes out of the ordinary way, ſpares the perſon of <hi>David,</hi> and imputes it upon the relation of <hi>David, viz.</hi> his Child; ſo in <hi>Davids</hi> ſeed he puniſhed <hi>Davids</hi> perſon; this is Gods uſual way in Scripture, and ſets his Majeſty out, to be full of mercy in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of Juſtice, he will take away the firſt born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that had not ſinned, and therein plagued <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and their Fathers that had ſinned; That this is mercy, conſider if <hi>David</hi> the ſinner be cut off for his ſin; there was then no room left to manifeſt repentance either in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:123663:81"/> 
                     <hi>David</hi> or the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet death muſt come that God may be juſt; and though nothing but Juſtice muſt take place, yet in that he will be as merciful as poſſible to ſtand with Juſtice; Therefore there is truly a Cauſe, for God to impute death to <hi>Davids</hi> Child, for <hi>Davids</hi> ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The ſecond Objection is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3. which ſeems alſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt this Doctrine in theſe words; <hi>Thou haſt moved me againſt</hi> Job <hi>without a Cauſe, he is a perfect and upright man, one that feareth God, and hateth evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God goeth in this out of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, as in the caſe of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. It will not be ſafe to imagin, that others are unconverted becauſe God meets not others ſo, ſometime God doth things to ſhew his Power, and Majeſty, and greatneſs over all, and his uſing inſtruments in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſe, as his raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the grave, and from death the widdows Son, and others, is no warrant for us to allude to caſes ordinary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here was a cauſe if not in <hi>Job,</hi> and indeed neceſſity that this ſhould come upon him, if we conſider, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>There is none like Job,</hi> ſaith God; <hi>doth he ſerve thee for naught?</hi> ſaith Satan, <hi>put but forth thy hand &amp;</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:123663:82"/> 
                     <hi>he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> Now that <hi>Job</hi> did not ſerve God juſt becauſe God had dealt ſo well with him, but would do it if God dealt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes with him, ſhall now appear, and the accuſer of the brethren be put to the worſt, who complains againſt <hi>Job,</hi> as envying his proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe this carriage of God to <hi>Job,</hi> can hardly be tearmed afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather ſome gratious condition by God made with <hi>Job</hi> to this purpoſe; <hi>Job</hi> thou art an upright man, thou feareſt me, and hateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Satan is ſtill complaining on thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he envies thy proſperity, and tels me thou wouldſt prove another man, then I take thee to be, if I ſhould try thee by adverſity, and take from thee thy proſperity; Now lets ſtop the mouth of this great adverſary, and lend me thy Oxen, and thy Aſſes, thy ſervants and thy Cammels, thy Children and all thy ſubſtance, and thy body for my ſervice, I will pay thee with great advantage, as appears by this following; <hi>So the Lord bleſſed the latter end of</hi> Job <hi>more than his beginning, for he had fourteen thouſand ſheep, &amp; ſix thouſand Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and a thouſand yoak of Oxen, and a thouſand ſhee Aſſes, and had alſo ſeven ſons and three daughters; ſo that the Lord gave</hi> Job <hi>twice as much as he had before,</hi> Job 42. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:123663:82"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The third Objection is grounded upon <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>The Righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart:</hi> Good men here are taken away by death, and no cauſe ſhewed; they have the teſtimony of good men, and yet taken away: It will be granted, they might have lived much longer for age, the text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it, and the Objection is the ſtronger by it; for it would be no matter of complaint, had they lived till very age had took them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for then we know all muſt die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The time theſe good men lived in, was a very evil time, and God takes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</p>

                  <p>Firſt, in judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 10. 11, 12. He hath called upon them by the Righteous, and warned them, but it would do them no good; now he will take away the Righteous from them, to ſee if they will lay it to heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in mercy to themſelves, they are taken away.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe by long living with ſuch, they muſt needs be a weary even of their lives, and their ſouls vexed from day to day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. 5. <hi>Wo is me that I dwell in the Tenis of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</hi> So Jer. 4. 14. <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart, my heart maketh</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:123663:83"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in mercy to them, becauſe the continuance of this temptation upon them, may at laſt ſo weary them out, as they may give up all as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 4. <hi>When he was old, his Wives turned away his heart after other gods.</hi> So Mat. 24. 21, 22. <hi>Then ſhall be great tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world, nor ever ſhall be; except thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned there could no fleſh be ſaved; but for the elects ſake, it ſhall be ſhortned:</hi> Even as our Proverb is, A continual dropping will wear a hole in the ſtone: ſo a continual oppreſſion may turn the wiſe man out of all; ſee for this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 14, &amp;c. He curſeth the day of his birth, and the man that brought tidings to his Father; wiſheth his Mother had been alwayes great with him, ſaying, <hi>Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to ſee labour and ſorrow, and that my dayes ſhould be conſumed with ſhame?</hi> Clearly noting, that any zealous heart, is ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched, when all he can do will not keep God from diſhonour; <hi>O blot me</hi> (ſaith Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) <hi>out of thy book.</hi> By this it may appear, that Gods afflicting men, is for ſome cauſe or other in them.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Fourthly, another Scripture that ſeems to complain by way of Objection is, <hi>John</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3. in theſe words; <hi>Who did ſin this man or his Father, that he is born blind?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer to which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Neither this man nor his Father, but that the power of God might appear;</hi> yet it is clear, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples underſtood this affliction in common muſt come for ſin; and Jeſus Chriſt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply notes the caſe more than common, ſaying, <hi>He was born for this purpoſe, that the work of God ſhould be manifeſted in him;</hi> It was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he was born, and he was born that a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of heaven might be ſhewed upon him; therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh between a caſe that is extraordinary, and one that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>Again, from the unwillingneſs that is in God to afflict; as a confirming Anſwer to all the Objections, it appears, that high provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in us, procure Afflictions to us; for till Juſtice cals ſo loud, that God cannot be juſt except he doth afflict, though in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he mixeth all with abundance of mercy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. <hi>The Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his Prophets, riſing up betimes and ſending them, becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</hi> That is, he was very pittiful, loath to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:123663:84"/> grieve or afflict them, till there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Juſtice called ſo long and loud for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 54. <hi>They did not deſtroy the Nations, but were mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and learned their works, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Idols; therefore was Gods wrath kindled, in ſo much that he abhorred his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: Nevertheleſs he regarded their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, when he heard their cry, and did pitty them.</hi> Hoſea 6. 4. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 7, 8. <hi>How ſhall I give the up? what ſhall I do to thee?</hi> What leſs doth all this ſignifie than thus much? that though God be ſo provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that nothing but Judgment muſt come, yet like a tender Father to an unruly Child, mourns over him, while he corrects him.

                  <p>Now Affliction you know, we have in the laſt <hi>Sign</hi> proved, is Gods Furnance to try the Nature of every Mettal by; ſo that you may truly paſs judgment upon your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no you are of the dying hand; not by your praying, here you may deceive your ſelves, though you pray mightily, for it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to do ſo in Affliction; but if you pray more for Afflictions being removed, than ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; that is, put up ſtrong cries to be eaſed of the trouble, but ſcarce poſſeſt with faint wiſhes to anſwer Gods deſign in the trouble; never inquiring, <hi>What have I done?</hi> or ſaying, I muſt be more humble, more thankful, more pittiful, more fearful, more careful all my dayes. What ſhall I do, ſaith the zealous man, to get good by this Affliction? his voyce cries
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:123663:85"/> louder for ſpiritual advantage, than his pain for natural freedome. Let us think of this and deal plainly with our own hearts, and ſee what way the pulſe beats moſt; for as the ſtaff you ſet up, will fall one way or other; ſo perſons being more or leſs ſpiritual, will eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it in Affliction. Iſrael of old might be read in this, and you know how God dealt with them, of ſix hundred thouſand, there was but two, namely, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Galeb,</hi> that entered the good Land of promiſe; they early begun to ſhow how carnal they was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 13, 14.

                  <p>For the proof of this, that there is as great unwillingneſs in God, from whom Affliction comes, to give it, as we to receive it: mind a little ſome texts of Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of that which is good?</hi> in the words go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before you have it thus written, <hi>But the face of the Lord is againſt them that do evil:</hi> That is, his favourable countenance is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch, and their portion is bitterneſs, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 17. <hi>But if ye be followers of that which is good, who will harm you?</hi> Here ſeems to be a holy challenge, to whatſoever may

                     <hi>the Crown is fallen from off our head, Wo unto us for we have ſinned,</hi> Lam. 15. 16. A multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Scriptures might be urged further to prove both unwillingneſs in God to afflict, and that the very Cauſe of all our Wo both temporal and eternal, is our miſdoing; <hi>O that my people had hearkened to my voyce, and walked in my wayes, I ſhould ſoon have ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their enemies, and turned my hand againſt their adverſaries,</hi> Pſal. 81. 13, 14. Now in reaſon were the Cauſe of Affliction, conſidered to be only from our ſelves, procured by our miſdoing, and ſent with tendency to our men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we ſhould ſurely pray more to have it ſanctified than removed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Ignorance of the Neceſſity of Affliction, is a Cauſe of this Decay; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unwillingneſs of God to bring it, and the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:123663:87"/> creature to indure it, fully proves, that there is Neceſſity for it; there cannot be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delightfulneſs in the creature to undergo lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, than there is in God to put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der languiſhing, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim? How ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Idma? <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>My heart is turned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, my repentings are kindled together,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 8. <hi>When he was come near, and beheld the City, he wept over it: Luke</hi> 19. 41. Now Gods unwillingneſs, proves the creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live at any ſpiritual rate without it; and indeed Experience proves the ſame, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 67. <hi>David</hi> wandred from the Fould, and were like to continue till Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſpoke to him, he forgot himſelf and what he was a doing, <hi>The wicked,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>are not in trouble as other men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they plagued like other men; therefore pride compaſſeth them about as a Chain, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence covereth them as a garment;</hi> and what uſe do they make of it? <hi>they ſay, how doth God know, and is there knowledge in the moſt High.</hi> This clearly notes, that a condition freeſt from trouble or affliction, generally is attended with carnalleſt behaviour God-ward, <hi>When I had fed them to the full, they then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:123663:88"/> 
                     <hi>Adultery, and aſſembled by troops into Harlots houſes,</hi> Jer. 5. 7. By all this it appears, that it is from ignorance of Afflictions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, if we pray more to have it removed than ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Ignorance of the End of Affliction, is a Cauſe of this Decay; now the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin, and the Neceſſity being to humble; the End is to ſave: Now all Gods dealings are mercy, whatſoever he doth to the creature, is like himſelf, and in it ſelf is mercy, if he give us all we deſire and would have, it is Mercy; if he keep us without it, it is Mercy; Health from him is Mercy, ſo is Sickneſs; Plenty from him is Mercy, ſo is Poverty; Health, Life, Strength, and ſuch like Favours temporal, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body will acknowledge to be Mercy; but their contrary few or none will account Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet this is Mercy alſo; for this Checquer work the World is made of, ſome at the ſame time are wringing their hands for ſorrow, while others are clapping their hands for joy; ſome with ſtrait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, through Sickneſs and Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are Weeping, others through Health and Plenty, rejoycing: Now the great difficulty is, how to bring the heart to look upon the ſtate of Weeping as truly Mercy, as the ſtate of Rejoycing: For which end conſider, why we do account Health, Plenty, and ſuch like
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:123663:88"/> Injoyments Mercy, but becauſe they have in them an eſteeming and deſirable good, a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſutable good; it is the ſame with the contrary, they are as ſeaſonable and as ſutable, could our frail hearts ſo receive them, for they are as truly from the Lord as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as truly have the ſame end in them. There are two great Ends in all God doth; one is his Honour; the other is our Salvation; now if God give us what we would have, his End is the ſame; and if he give us the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his End is the ſame; and Chriſtians cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſconſtruing his End to be Mercy, is the Cauſe they miſconſtrue his Actions to be Mercy: That both are Mercy, read <hi>Exod.</hi> 13 17. There <hi>God led them through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> an unbeaten way, <hi>where they wanted both bread and water,</hi> and yet both End and Action Mercy, to bring them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and deliver them from harm by the <hi>Philiſtines: Remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee theſe forty years, through that great and terrible wilderneſs, wherein was fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Scorpions, and Drought and no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that he might humble thee, and prove thee to the good at thy latter end.</hi> It is too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that Iſrael conſtrued this hard dealing from God, but it was great Mercy, as the text fully proves. Ignorance therefore of the End
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:123663:89"/> of Affliction, is a Cauſe why we pray more to have it Removed than Sanctified.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, content not your ſelves on this ſide a heart ſo tender, as to be under continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al feeling fear of God and his Judgments.

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:123663:96"/> Thought is the leaſt motion of the mind, and whether it be wicked or good, is not hid from God, nor from Gods Vice-gerent, even Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; <hi>No thought can be with-held from thee, Job</hi> 42. 2.

                     </gap>e, ſlay iniquity in its firſt motion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The firſt Mark may be this, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God hath pardoned the ſins you once li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, you are not ſo abaſed in your own eyes, ſo as to walk humbler with God all your dayes: Now this is Gods great end in forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 62, 63. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord, that thou maiſt remember,</hi> (mark that) <hi>and be confounded, and never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thy mouth more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee.</hi> So Ezek. 36. 29, 30, 31. <hi>I alſo will ſave you from all your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes,</hi> both guilt and filth, <hi>then ſhall you remember your own evil wayes, and ſhall loath</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:123663:97"/> 
                     <hi>your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for your abominations.</hi> So that you ſee, God expects to receive fruit from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, When becauſe of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you are in any meaſure lifted up, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire grace more than giver: By grace here, I mean the Graces of Gifts, as ability to pray, or preach, &amp;c. diſtinct from the Graces of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Meekneſs and Charity, for a man may be rich in the one, and yet poor in the other; Now Gods uſual meaſure of beſtowing the Graces of Gifts, at ſuch times, and to ſuch perſons as have been very rebellious, yet are returned to the Shepheard of their ſouls: Now again you muſt diſtinguiſh between Graces and Gifts, with what allowance the Scripture gives, otherwiſe ye will confound hoth by mixing them together; for though Graces be Gifts, and Gifts be Graces, yet are they not ſuch as prove, that of neceſſity where the Gifts or Graces of Preaching, or Praying, or Knowledge, or Tongues are, there will be the Graces of Humility and Thankfulneſs; though it will prove there ſhould be ſuch Graces; the reaſon I conceive lyeth here, and it may be worthy our noting, (thus) The Graces of Gifts in the ſenſe we diſtinguiſh, are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly given of God for the benefit of others;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:123663:97"/> as he gave his Spirit to <hi>Saul,</hi> for the benefit of Iſrael: Now other Graces are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly given for the profit of our ſelves, becauſe with the one we may periſh, without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we cannot be ſaved: Now both this dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sign, and the diſtinction may be of uſe, if conſidered among Churches, for experience tells us, while the humble in heart have ſtood with their low and mean parts, in the mean time thoſe tall in Gifts have fallen, like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> and it is good none here be ſecure, for though Gifts be Graces, and that from God the giver, yet may a perſon fall in love with the Gift, and himſelf for the Gift, as to be lifted up to the forgetting God the Giver, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 15, 16. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. 25.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third ſign of Gods ſuffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to fall into ſin, may be this; When ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal favours from God given you are not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but forgotten: There is none that lives but are more or leſs tryed by God in this very kind, ſome time or other of their life, for they are not only ſharers in Gods common favors, that he dayly beſtows upon all, as Rain, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeaſons, food, rayment, health, ſtrength, and the like; but alſo ſignal and ſpecial favors, as Redemption from the Grave, when at the very brinck to viſible view, even favours of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:123663:98"/> ſuch like kind as Iſrael had, when the firſt-born in <hi>Egypt</hi> dyed, not a Dog barks againſt Iſrael; when Plague or Sword ſweeps away by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, on our right hand, and on our left, and we remain untouched; this certainly is never to be forgotten: ſo the red Sea deliverance, the pillar of Cloud by day, and of Fire by night, together with the dividing of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> are Parables doubtleſs in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel dayes, and we under as gracious Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to remember with thankfulneſs Gods lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs: <hi>David</hi> that good man, makes obſervation in this caſe of old Iſrael, and hath left their ſtain for Generations to come, to read and take warning by, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. God rebuked the red Sea, and it was dryed up, and redeemed them from the hand of their enemies; <hi>yet they ſoon forgot his works, and waited not for his counſel;</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 24. <hi>Hezekiah was ſick to death, and he prayed to God, and he gave him a ſign; but Hezekiah rendred not again according to the benefit done him;</hi> (mark that) his return was not as ſignal as his favour, therefore God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers wrath to come upon him; by all which it is clear, that more than ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ary favours, cals for more than ordinary returns; and where its a wanting, God is provoked to ſuffer ſuch to fall: I pray God make this hint as accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:123663:98"/> as it is ſeaſonable, to thoſe that ſhall meet with it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A fourth Mark how perſons may know when God will ſuffer them to fall into Sin; When under great ſtraits, you are not much with God for wiſdome and counſel; Neglect here muſt needs be dangerous, for it is a kind of tempting God, a daring as it were the holy One of Iſrael: When under great ſtraits that for good ends he brings upon them, they are careleſs to requeſt his help for their eſcaping, and anſwerable gaining. No man that trades in the way to heaven, but at times is exerciſed with great ſtraits of one kind or another, the very entrance into it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth nothing leſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him take up his Croſs dayly and follow me:</hi> So that Jeſus Chriſt would have perſons count upon meeting with hard things, that will be his Diſciples; <hi>For man is born to trouble as the ſparks flie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Job 5. 7. Now that none may ſinck under them, Jeſus Chriſt hath made proviſion, which if they neglect they are like to periſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 4. <hi>The Shepheard ſhall be ſmitten, and the Sheep all ſcattered;</hi> now the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt ſuch a danger, is, <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> Luke 21. 26. <hi>Mens hearts failing them for fear,</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:123663:99"/> 
                     <hi>and for looking after what ſhall come to paſs; for the Powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore watch ye and pray alwayes, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape.</hi> By theſe Texts, together with <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Be careful for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in every thing by prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> Clearly noting, that perſons under ſtraits, are not in Gods ſecurity out of the way of prayer; well therefore may this prove an acceptable caution to every Chriſtian, when he undergoeth his ſhare in the Croſs of Jeſus, to make his complaint and earneſt cries to him by prayer, with ſupplication; No doubt but ſuch will find Chriſt ſeaſonably helping him: but if you find a ſecure drowſineſs attend the heart, then conclude your miſery is not yet at the height: The Diſciples are found aſleep three times together, and cannot watch with their Lord one hour, before their miſery will be greater by his being taken from them: but I ſhall end this Mark, leaving for our gracious pattern the example of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Agony and ſwet,</hi> as it were great drops of blood, he at that time, <hi>prayed the more earneſtly,</hi> Luke 22. 44.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When you readily cloſe with occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſin; this tempts the Devil to tempt you, and tempts God to leave you; <hi>Sampſon</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:123663:99"/> in <hi>Judges</hi> 14. ſeeks to take a Wife among the Uncircumciſed, that he might <hi>ſeek an occaſion againſt them:</hi> Even ſo, doth not the Devil make his attempts, whereby he may give an occaſion to Gods People to ſin; The ready clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wherewith, tempteth him further to tempt them; and indeed tempteth God to leave them: Now occaſions to ſin comes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, and from different objects, that may have but little beginning, and yet tall concluſions; ſometimes the ear heareth that which ſets the heart on fire; ſometimes the eye ſeeth, that which brings wo to the mind; witneſs <hi>David,</hi> who at the top of his roof, as he was walking, ſeeth <hi>Bathſheba</hi> waſhing her ſelf, and her beauty paſſing through the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his eyes; this ſmall occaſion took poſſeſſion, and made him a priſoner to his great overthrow: ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Achan ſaw among the ſpoils, a goodly Babyloniſh Garment, and a Wedge of Gold; his eye look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his heart luſted till he was ruined.</hi> Now every man that knoweth any thing of ſins way, knows, that it ſeeks and takes occaſion from very ſmall beginnings; <hi>Behold how great a fire a little ſpark kindleth;</hi> it begins by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, taking its degrees, and is carried through the eyes to the thoughts, then to conception, then to affection, then to conſent, then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:123663:100"/> Now the proviſion the holy Scripture makes in this kind, is poſitively engaged by way of Precept, <hi>To aſtain from all appear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. Clearly noting, that in order to perſons certain ſecurity from the commiſſion of all evil, they muſt abſtain from its Appearance: Very obſervable is Gods care to Iſrael of old, no ſooner were they out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he ſeeks to take all occaſions of ſin out of their way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>And it came to paſs, that when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>had let the People go, that God led them not through the Land of the</hi> Philiſtines, <hi>although it was near,</hi> (note that) <hi>leſt peradventure the people ſee War, and return to Egypt again.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 13, 33. Alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 24, 25. <hi>They muſt cut down their graven Images, and burn them with fire, and deſire none of the ſilver thats on them, leſt they be a ſnare unto them.</hi> So the Wiſe-man, counſels to <hi>make no friendſhip with an angry man, and with a furious man; no not to go, leſt we learn his wayes, and get a ſnare to our ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When you are not pittiful to the tempted, but in your proſperity forget their calamity; God is pleaſed many times to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Satan to be let looſe upon ſome Chriſtians, and to try them ſorely, yea, to engage them deep in actual War, whileſt other Chriſtians
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:123663:100"/> as it were, are lookers on; to let the one ſee how weak he is in the hands of this ſpiritual Adverſary, if left to himſelf; and to try the other, what frame of heart he carries towards his brother in diſtreſs, and this if wiſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved turns to the great advantage of both: The perſonal ſufferer, if he endure, becomes heir to the promiſe, annexed to the condition of the tempted, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 12. And the looker on, if he by beholding is ſo enflamed with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous love and pitty to his ſuffering brother, that he greatly ſuffers alſo: <hi>The one is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other burns,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 29. When all the ſtrength a poor tempted ſoul hath, is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in hot fight with the Devil, fleſh, and world, then pitty from lookers on, proves like a freſh recruit to a ſhattered Army, it ſo ſuits with Gods will, and with the tempteds want; whereas on the contrary, want of pitty in lookers on, as it ſtrengthens the hands of the Adverſary, and tempts the courage of the troubled to grow flat: Now this ſixth Mark is framed to that end, if the Lord will, that lookers on may not only know what frame of heart they are to be of in ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but to provoke them to make haſte to it; in <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 4. there was neglect to this duty, and it meets with a ſad ſalute; <hi>Wo to them that are at eaſe in Zion, that lie upon beds of</hi>

Great hath been the trouble of ſuch Churches as can witneſs this decay to have been amongſt them; it ſtill took the moſt inconſiderate, that lived too much below compariſon in Gods Law, where or when to be more or leſs in condeſcention in order to the beſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining edification; which is the great end of all inſtitution: they forgetting, or not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:123663:105"/> this, have gone ſo unſeaſonable about ſetting up the leſſer, that they have debaſed the weightier; making the remedy prove far worſe than the diſeaſe; carrying on this work with ſuch manner of management, that an indifferent ſtander by could not but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that ſure the whole will of God, lay in the one, two, or three leſſer things, that they ſo pleaded for; eſpecially, ſeeing it carryed on with that heat of Spirit, &amp; reſolution of taking place, that the bonds of love, and Church Communion could not hold them.</p>
                  <p>Whence hath the diviſions among the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Churches, both in affection and practice riſen, if not from this very root? Cannot hundreds witneſs, yea and mourn for what they know in this matter? hath not the great law of love, and the great deſign of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to wit, Edification, been ſacrificed for the will of ſome novelties?

Doth not the adverſary hinder the building greatly, while he can truly ſay, do you not ſee how they are divided among themſelves, and lay low one another? doth not alſo the conſcious ſeeker ſtumble greatly at this, and ſay, what ſhall I do? where to ſettle I cannot tell?

O that the Lord would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to awaken the upright! yet to make it their prayer, and care night and day, how they may in places, times, things, eſpecially in the main, both to ſpeak and do the ſame thing; this will be bleſſed with better ſucceſs to God, and Goſpel, in one year, then the beſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of another kind, for time paſt hath been in ſome years.</p>

To fortifie the mind with ſpiritual materials: and thus I have done with the firſt mark, and come to the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is the Spirits work, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Chriſtian man, wherein his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger moſt lies; that is, by what bait, and to what evils the tempter is moſt like to draw him; Ignorance here cauſeth people go into the tempters way, and without defilement more or leſs they can hardly return, and ſurely <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes to this in one of his petitions to God for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. <hi>What prayer and ſupplication ſoever be made by any man, or by all thy people Iſrael, which ſhall know every man the </hi>

                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:123663:110"/> 
                     <hi>through the way of the</hi> Philiſtines; <hi>although that was near, for God ſaid, leſt they repent when they ſee war, and return to</hi> Egypt <hi>again.</hi> It is very queſtionable, if not out of doubt; that this danger was not in their eye at all, <hi>but God led them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes,) by his Spirit</hi> ſaith <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> clearly noting, that perſons hearkning, find the holy Spirit not wanting to lead them in the beſt way, and ſet before them the greateſt danger; one text more and ſo I have done with this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 24. <hi>They alſo that erred in Spirit, ſhall come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and they that murmured ſhall learn Doctrine.</hi> They that through ignorance went aſtray ſhall come to underſtanding, or know their beſt way; and they that did repine ſhall learn Doctrine, or be better taught.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Spirits work is to diſcover both the ſtrength of the tempter, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhowing to the Chriſtian man theſe two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, that the tempter can but intice, not inforce.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, that the ſtrength of his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lies in preſent things.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, he can and doth prepare ſuitable baits and ſnares, but all he doth do, and can do, amounts but to thus much; <hi>Therefore greater is he that is in you, than he that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:123663:110"/> 
                     <hi>you;</hi> which conſideration tends great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a believers ſupport, while he is able to ſay, I know it muſt be my fault if I ſin againſt my God, for the tempter cannot force me, neither did he ever force any, he can and doth proffer his ware, putting the beſt face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>And the Serpent ſaith to the Woman, ye ſhall not ſurely die; for God doth know in the day you eat thereof, your eyes ſhall be opened, and ſhall be as Gods, knowing good, and evil;</hi> here he makes his bait pleaſant, and to promiſe greater priviledge than yet they had; with which the woman is taken; <hi>And when the Woman ſaw that the fruit was good, and that it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eye, ſhee took thereof and did eat;</hi> contrary to the Law: ſo <hi>Joſh</hi> 7. 20, 21. <hi>When</hi> Achan <hi>ſaw among the ſpoils a goodly Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Garment, and a wedge of Gold, he coveted them;</hi> which notes, that the Devils power to take, centers in preparing fair outſides, which carries ſome after deſtruction, as the Oxe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſlaughter, not knowing that it is for his life; and indeed as his trade lies in ſhows, ſo the people he tradeth among, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not trade at all to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) are ſilly people; and though ſilly people, yet he tradeth altogether in the dark, and therefore is called the <hi>Ruler of darkneſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:123663:111"/> 
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12: And <hi>his Kingdome</hi> a <hi>Kingdome of darkneſs,</hi> Col. 1. 3. <hi>&amp; dare not come to the light for fear his deeds ſhould be made manifeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as he thus trades, and theſe are the people he tradeth with; ſo the ſtrength of his temptations centers in preſent things; It is all he can make ſnares and temptations of, as is evident by theſe Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>The ſufferings of this </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Preſent </hi>
                     <hi>world are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in us:</hi> ſo Gal. 1. 4. <hi>who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from this </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent </hi>
                     <hi>evil World.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. Demas <hi>hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, having imbraced the </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Preſent </hi>
                     <hi>World;</hi> Now all theſe Scriptures ſpeak the tempters ſtrength to lie in preſent things, which made the holy Apoſtle have light account of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>For our light Affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> he compareth it with the ſtate to come, gives it the next count to a cypher, calling it momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; and the utmoſt we can make, or any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that lives at greateſt height of worldly pleaſure, muſt confeſs all preſent things will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to but theſe three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as goeth but ſhin deep.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such as may properly be called minute joy, that that is ours this minute, but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:123663:111"/> either it taken from us, or we from it next mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, it laſts not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, At the longeſt worldly pleaſure ſerveth us but till we come to the grave, and there it leaves us.</p>
                  <p>Having now done with the third Diſcovery of the holy Spirits help, I ſhall briefly add two or three more, and paſs to the Twenty ninth <hi>Sign</hi> of a dying Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The holy Spirit diſcovers what unprofitableneſs is found in ſin after commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, working ſtrong convictions upon the heart of the ſinner, and forceth him to confeſs that his eager purſuit after his ſin, now he hath had his hearts deſire granted, contracts but wo and ſorrow, though ſweet in the mouth while eating, yet bitter in the belly when eaten, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 36, 37. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in Exchange for his ſoul?</hi> When ſuch Texts as this is brought home to the conſcience, it doth ſo awaken where not willingly withſtood, that ſins hold muſt needs fall.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Spirit furniſheth the Chriſtian with ſpiritual Arguments, bearing ſuch force upon his heart, as makes him able to break out with ſuch replies as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All the Devil hath to make an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:123663:112"/> of, is but preſent things, and they ſuit not with my perſon, for my perſon is made up of ſoul and body, and all he offereth, doth but reſpect and ſerve that body, that ſhortly muſt be worms-meat; and therefore it will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit me to loſe my ſoul for preſent things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As all he hath to make an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, ſuits not with my perſon; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it ſuits not with my condition, for if I have all that heart can wiſh, it carries me but to the grave, and there leaves me, and wo be to me if ſuch works follow me; for alas I muſt be raiſed again, and he that <hi>ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The holy Spirit helps in lending the immediate ſupplies of new ſtrength propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to our ſtraits, and will not <hi>ſuffer thoſe that wait on him, to be tempted above what they are able to bear, but will with the temptation make way to eſcape, that they may be able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The holy Spirit helps by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with the heart, to draw it after holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, following the ſoul up and down with ſweet viſits, and ſecret whiſpers, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inclining it God-ward, preparing a ſeaſon for the heart to draw nigh God, and then preparing the heart for that ſeaſon: <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:123663:112"/> 
                     <hi>what to pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. May not all this teach us, to put a high value upon the holy Spirits Help, to the great work of Mortification, by all means ſtriving to pleaſe and not grieve this holy Spirit, by which we are <hi>ſealed to the day of Redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having now ſpoken of the holy Spirits help, may not ſome from hence inquire, what may be done to the obtaining, not only its viſits now and then, as a wafaring man that tarrieth for a night; but its conſtant company to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with the ſoul?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There may be three Directions laid down briefly, for its obtaining; with three Directions for its keeping.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, for its obtaining; Get a deep ſenſe of its want and worth.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Get longings of heart after its ſupply.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, Make humble ſupplications to the Father for it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, Get a deep ſenſe of its want and worth; its Jeſus Chriſts own argument, that the <hi>world cannot receive this Spirit, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> John 14. 17. Now by perſonal examination of that ſouls barrenneſs, where the holy Spirit either
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:123663:113"/> comes but ſeldome, or ſtayes not long, may ſome conſiderable ſenſe of its want be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſequently of its worth; all thoſe black, ſinful works acted by the ſons of men, are the effects of the holy Spirits abſence; and indeed to what degree, a good man is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger here, to that degree he is weak an unable, either to make right judgment of the beſt things, or to withſtand the temptations and vexatious aſſaults of the evil one; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man be thus deſtitute where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is wanting, yet can there be no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of his company, till a deep ſenſe both of its want and worth affect the heart, to the rendring the ſoul capable of ſetting a valuable eſtimation of its company.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for its obtaining, Get longings of heart after its ſupply; breathings and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings from a ſenſe of its want, baſtens its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; a foul that goeth ſadly up and down all the day long, ſick as it were of love, for its frequent viſits, to revive comfort and ſtrength; and to diſcover its own wants, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wiles; making the ſoul taller by head and ſhoulders, than thoſe temptations that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attend it, ſaying with <hi>David, As the Hart panteth after the water brooks; ſo pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my ſoul after thee O God: My ſoul thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth for the living God, when ſhall I come and</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:123663:113"/> 
                     <hi>appear before thee?</hi> Or be filled with ſupplies from thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for its obtaining, Make humble ſupplications to the Father for it; not only ſick of love, with the Spouſe; but alſo pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting with <hi>David,</hi> yet reſts not here, but is again and again upon its knees, with humble hearty ſupplications to God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Father; like the thirſty traveller, that going from Fountain to Fountain, from means to means, till he get what his ſoul travelleth after: when Jeſus Chriſt were about to leave the Diſciples, this was one of the laſt Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies he gave them; <hi>And I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> John 14. 16. <hi>If ye being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children; how much more ſhall your heavenly Father, give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Luke 11. 13.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, we may offer three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, in order to the ſure keeping the holy Spirits company, or holding conſtant fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and dear inward intimate familiarity with ſo happy a companion.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, A conſtant withſtanding the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of all evil.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, A ready complyance with new motions to all good.</item>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:123663:114"/>
                     <item> Thirdly, A retaining in the heart, a high value of its company.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, A conſtant withſtanding the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of all evil; is that which will wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully engage the Spirits company; when you cruſh ſin in its leaſt and firſt motion: Now the deareſt of Gods Children are lyable to temptation, and it is not their ſin to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſin, Jeſus Chriſt was tempted to ſin; their ſin lyeth in cloſing with the temptation; but if inſtead of cloſing with it, you do in the Spirits ſtrength conſtantly oppoſe it: miſtake me not here, I pray you, a conſtant oppoſing ſin, doth not intend leſs than theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A firm withſtanding the very firſt leaſt motion, even a glance as it were, at the eye ear or thought to ſin; <hi>Abſtain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the firſt leaſt motion, ſo in all caſes and conditions, whether the temptation ſet upon you when ye are full, or hungry, ſick or well, ſtrong or weak, rich or poor, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or out of affliction, it will be coming with new aſſaults in all conditions, waiting to kill you by a <hi>Goliah</hi> or <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations more piercing, or more pleaſing; [Conſtant] intends a withſtanding here.</p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:123663:114"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Conſtant intends continual; <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that endureth temptation: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of life,</hi> James 1. 12. Revel. 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Help to retain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, may be this; A ready complyance with new motions to all good; it is as proper for the holy Spirit to be prompting the heart to good if hearkned to, as for the fire to give heat, waiting upon the ſoul in every ſeaſon, whether of rejoycings or weepings, whether of doing Gods will or ſuffering for his name; ſtill to be putting ſuch as wait upon it into ſome ſuch action as tends to their enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heaven-ward; but it muſt be quietly and ſilently heeded, that when it ſaith, <hi>Seek my face;</hi> the anſwer may be, <hi>Thy face will I ſeek.</hi> Great care and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r therefore muſt be had, that we neither grieve it, by not hearing what it ſaith, or not doing what it bids; nor yet quench or lightly eſteem thoſe gracious ſervices it prompts us to.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third Help may be this; A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in the heart a high value of its compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; this is the way to keep, and to be rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſt with the company of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; it cannot dwell where it is not valued at the higheſt rate; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ignorance of its worth and work, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:123663:115"/> the ſoul, to high expectations, being ignorant both of the ability and delight, that eſſencially abides in the holy Spirit, to be greatning in the heart things to come, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening in the heart things preſent. Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus could not in one place, do many mighty works, becauſe of their unbelief; the low and mean eſteem of him, leſſened their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him: Now the <hi>Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God;</hi> We are therefore called upon to be <hi>filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and if we <hi>live in it, to walk after it, being ſtrengthened with its might in the inward man,</hi> to a full underſtanding the deep things of God: Labour therefore, praying over this, to retain in your hearts an high value of its company.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:123663:116"/> is a very high crime, it being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that their ignorance of their ſtanding, growing or declining in heavenly things, doth not come upon them for want of Goſpel means, allowed on Gods part in order to their being fruitful; but that under ſufficient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance in order to their growth, they prove empty, dry, and huskiſh; yea and ſuch, that were otherwiſe in the dayes of their firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſal: but length of time in Goſpel ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for want of due care to obſerve Goſpel ends, they have by little &amp; little entertained Spiritual ſlumber, &amp; ſo loſe their ſtomack to, and reliſh of the true uſe and powerful end; Means from God to them hath been ſo long continued, and ſo by long cuſtome in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, come as his people come, ſit before him as his people do, and hear his word day by day, but do it not, or live not like it, having <hi>a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof,</hi> viz. the ſpiritual end deſigned by God in giving the forme, being not liſted up to, provokes God to complain againſt ſuch of old, <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters crib, but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my people doth not conſider; though I have nouriſhed and brought them up, yet they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not that I taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>to go, taking him by the armes; but he knew not that I had</hi>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:123663:118"/> 
                     <hi>Lord, have we not prophecied in thy Name, and caſt out Devils? Then will I ſay, Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I never knew you: Let none therefore truſt in lying words, which cannot profit, ſaying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord; the Temple of the Lord are theſe, that ye throughly amend your wayes and your doings; then will I cauſe you to dwell ſafely,</hi> Jer. 7. beginning.</p>
                  <p>But alas how few lay to heart, the great good Salvation, and deliverance from the great hurt Damnation, eying with all trembling the road way in which God will both give the one, and with-hold the other; ſurely, ſurely, this carnal ſecurity, the ſouls damning ſin, would never ſo poſſeſs perſons, rocking them aſleep, did they but with all diligence conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſecurity of all kinds about hereafter Glory, without theſe marks of hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, and actual endeavouring the new creatures life, in the meaſure called for, as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable and to be attained in the Scripture of truth, nothing being more evident, then that ſuch make it their whole buſineſs, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about thoſe ſoul-ſearching texts, that ſpeak out ſalvation by Chriſt Jeſus, upon no leſs terms, than hearty deſigning, with actual endeavouring to live like Chriſt Jeſus, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conformity to his will; I ſhall beg of God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:123663:118"/> there may be by them that read this, theſe five following Scriptures duly weighed, which with the help of his grace, may ſerve as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, or tend to the rouzing up of the ſoul from this damning ſin of carnal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life,</hi> or alive, <hi>becauſe of,</hi> or unto <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature, old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new.</hi> Gal. 5. 24. <hi>And they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi> 1 John 2. 6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf ſo to walk, even as he walked.</hi> Chap. 3. 3. <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> Doth not theſe great Scriptures with one mouth, tell you the high road way to hereafter Glory, and prohibit any man from daring to promiſe himſelf the ſame upon any other terms, or in any or her way; wherefore my brethren, ſeeing that ye, or if you look for ſuch things, be diligent that <hi>ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Cauſe of perſons being ſo ſenſeleſs, is, Contentment with out-ſide
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:123663:119"/> Chriſtianity; that is, frequent in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe Services that relate to the Worſhip of God, but the thing deſigned by God to be reached after and obtained, is not purſuied. It is evident both from Scripture and Experience, that perſons have been and are frequent in hearing Sermons, in Prayer, in Reading, in Faſting, and ſuch like performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet they remain very carnal and unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: Now Gods gracious End in giving ſuch ſpiritual priviledges to perſons, being by him deſigned to beget them to his ſpiritual likeneſs, and his End not brought about, muſt needs argue ſuch, not, or little further than out-ſide performances, contenting themſelves with their Services ſo done, that leaves three parts of four yet to do; for what pleaſure can God take in thoſe, that after long ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the opportunities of getting both inward and outward excellency, in that that makes Chriſtianity honourable, while they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as fruitleſs as the Figg-Tree, having a great ſhow at diſtance, and nothing but leaves at hand: Doth not Jeſus Chriſt in ſo many words except againſt ſuch, as not rightly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for his Kingdome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>But I ſay to you, except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:123663:119"/> 
                     <hi>Heaven:</hi> Their righteouſneſs will not do, and yet they are known to be a People much in prayer, Faſting and giving Alms, which are in themſelves good things, and yet they not accepted of God, but for all this his Woes goeth out againſt them? May it not be feared, that hundreds in our dayes, content themſelves with ſcarce going thus far in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts, yet retain a ſtrong opinion that all ſhall be well with them hereafter; as though ſuch confidence of being ſaved, as they that act it are content with, would content God; but let not ſuch deceive themſelves: and they may find that confidence about hereafter ſafety, not being acted by penitent ſubjects, whoſe hearts can witneſs a through change, will return to themſelves back again, charged with preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, notwithſtanding all their outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: And it is moſt ſure, as hath been premiſed in the laſt <hi>Sign,</hi> that the holy Spirit bears not witneſs with ſuch ſpirits, that they are Gods Children, &amp; that becauſe while they remain thus content with out-ſide Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Reformation reacheth not the heart; and then is a wanting that awful reverence of God and of Chriſt within, that commands without, the tongue ſo to talk, the eyes ſo to look, the hands ſo to act, the feet ſo to walk in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, as to be truly deemed his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:123663:120"/> 
                     <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men, foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt.</hi> But we ſhall leave this to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and paſs to the third and laſt Head.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Perſons are ſo ſenſeleſs of their ſpiritual eſtate, by not being converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things to come: Now things to come are reduceable in ſpecial to theſe four heads; Death, Judgment, Salvation, Damnation: all which are matters (not of ſhow) but of certainty, and may be called the four laſt things, which every man ought to make his four firſt things, that he furniſheth his heart withal, becauſe indeed they are Religions great cauſe, and bounds; Heavens great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to call us to duty, our great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſubmit to Heavens call. And as theſe hath more or leſs force upon the heart, they may be more or leſs read in the life; the worſt of men whoſe conſciences are not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will be found under ſome awakenings, by but reflecting here, now, and then, ſo forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are they, where in the loweſt ſenſe but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; Now that perſons, not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about theſe mighty matters, prepares way to ſpiritual ſenſeleſneſs, is very evident; and therefore when God complains of his peoples unequal walking, he either aſſigns it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:123663:120"/> to their negligence here, as the cauſe they ſo walk, or ſeeks to poſſeſs them with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance here, as a moſt quickning remedy; <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo conſider in thine heart, that as a man chaſtneth his Son, ſo the Lord thy God chaſteneth thee;</hi> and the reaſon of this is given by God himſelf, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt ſtrong, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>I fed thee with Manna in the Wilderneſs, which thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knew not, that I might humble thee, and prove thee, to do thee good at thy </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">latter end;</hi> (mark that) at thy latter end, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. 15. <hi>But</hi> Jeſurun <hi>waxed fat, and kicked, then he forſook God which made him, and lightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the Rock of his Salvation;</hi> you ſee here <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſet not a value on making God his ſafety, but waxed wanton, and forgot who had formed him; now the moſt reduceable means we find urged is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. thus, <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtand this, and would conſider their </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">latter end:</hi> God bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with deſire they would look before them, intimating that would they but look upon hereafter, they would live after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rate here; pertinent to this is, that <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. <hi>And thou mourn at </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">laſt, </hi>
                     <hi>when thy fleſh and thy body are conſumed; and thou ſay, how have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof, and obeyed not the voyce of</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:123663:121"/> 
                     <hi>my teachers, nor incline my ear to them, that inſtructed me; becauſe there is wrath, beware leſt he take thee away with the ſtroak, and then a great ranſome cannot deliver thee.</hi> Job 36, 18. Doth not all theſe Scriptures ſhow the miſerable ſtate of ſuch, as are not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about things to come; and how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to be reformed while they remain ſtrangers to theſe great conſiderations: now on the contrary what more contributes to a ſpiritual growth, than hourly Communion about theſe mighty matters? no conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being of a more mortifying force than Grave conſiderations; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether good or bad: knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Terror </hi>
                     <hi>of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> This holy Apoſtle no ſooner treats of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as his Doctrine, but to awaken and perſwade from its terror, is his Application: alſo Jeſus Chriſt to deter men from evil, and to compoſe them to good, gives ſuch awakning Items as theſe, <hi>If thy right hand offend,</hi> part with it, <hi>rather than be caſt into Hell fire; where the worm never dies, and the fire is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quenched:</hi> Three times together doth he in that 9. <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Mark,</hi> labour to rivet
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:123663:121"/> upon the hearers what miſery is to come, and by the worm and fires being, notes certainty; and by the worms gnawing, and fires bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, notes its miſery; and by the worms not dying, and the fires not being quenced, notes its eternity. Who would not at this, cry out with <hi>David; Oh God my fleſh trembleth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thee, for I am affraid of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> Chriſt Jeſus three fold repetition ſeems plainly to ſhow us what great aptneſs there is in every body to loſe the Spiritual force of ſuch mighty matters; they being the proper object only of a lively faith, that looks at things to come, with ſuch eſtimation as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures an inward trembling before God, to take one ſtep aſide from God.</p>
                  <p>But alas, alas, how many be there that ſtop the mouth of conſcience all they can from ſpeaking of this <hi rend="blackletterType">State</hi> to come, and will not endure to hear of the Grave, or Judgment, Salvation, or Damnation, though ſuch as will not endure the bitter of theſe things here, cannot enjoy the beſt of them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; It is living now in a holy awe of them here, that will make us live above the fear of them hereafter: content not your ſelves then for a thouſand Worlds, at any diſtance from daily communion with the things to come; talk with them face to face, as a man talks
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:123663:122"/> with his friend, and go aſide often from all other buſineſs, into your cloſet, or garden, field, or wilderneſs, nay, into any ſolitary place on purpoſe to talk with the Grave, how ſhortly you muſt put off your cloaths (or outward garments) and never more put them on, ſaying with <hi>Job, My foundation is in the duſt; if I wait, the graves my houſe, I have made my bed in the darkneſs; and ſaid to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thou art my Father, and to the worm thou art my Mother, and my Siſter,</hi> Job 17. 13. 14.</p>

Are you aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to hear that ſuch a one is turned again <hi>to his farm, another to his merchandize?</hi> One gone back to <hi>Egypt</hi> again, another willing to ſtay in the Wilderneſs, and many moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing if it prove coſtly, either to paſs over <hi>Jordan,</hi> or by <hi>Jerico,</hi> though it be Gods great road way to <hi>Canaan:</hi> Remember how it was once with you, enquire how it is with you now; when ye meet one another, is your talk heavenly or earthly? what do ye Savour moſt? what deſign ſeek ye moſt to carry on? in all company who are ye for, the world that is, or the world to come? Do ye ask one another when you meet, what trade goeth forward with you moſt? Are ye telling meekly and frequently each other, what God hath done for your ſouls? What yearnings of heart is in you after theſe ſolemn aſſemblies? Do you count it worthy your time to be often there? Do you go and pray, and pray before you go, that you may duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully meet God, and he profitably meet you? doth Chriſts eye conſtrain you to come thither or the Churches eye? when you are hindred what is your fear? How is your care? Can you be well content to be lightly abſent, if the Church will be content with your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:123663:124"/> Doth the Decay in Chriſts Houſe, or in your houſe trouble you moſt? Can you quietly bear Decay in Chriſts Spiritual Houſe, while you keep from Decay in your temporal Houſe? Can you ſee afflictions pierce the ſides of ſome bitterly, and you not weep with them? Was it thus with you once, were not others ſorrows your tears? Did you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to mourn with the mourner, and rejoyce with the ſinger? Are you now leſs able than formerly to withſtand temptations? Will a ſmall offence make you ſo impatient as to commit great ſin? Is Satan almoſt at every little turn too hard for you? Are you bafled quickly now with every little blow? Are you ſo dry and barren of the Spirits waterings, that now every touch takes you? How is it with you when troubles are upon you? Are you more or leſs than you were wont to be in prayer? Whether is your care now moſt to know afflictions cauſe or cure? What way tends the ſtrivings of your heart moſt, when Gods ſtroak is upon you? Would you part with the Rod upon any terms, or undergo it longer, to have it ſanctified the ſurer? doth affliction mend you or make you worſe? How are you when the Rod is gone? Can you truly ſay with <hi>David, Before I was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted I went aſtray,</hi> and as truly ſay, <hi>But</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:123663:125"/> 
                     <hi>now I have learned to keep thy word;</hi> What are your thoughts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Land you were redeemed from? Would you go thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Is your old ſin, or ſins in any meaſure pleaſant to you again? Are you taken with the thoughts of your baſeſt Lovers, whoſe paths led you to the gates of Hell? Doth the great work of Mortification go forward or backward? Doth ſin get head or loſe head in you? Are you not indeed wholly ignorant as to your ſpiritual eſtate, whether you grow or decay.</p>
                  <p>But laſt of all, and moſt of all; Doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of time in Chriſts acquaintance, work decreaſe of affection to Chriſts company? Ah Lord God, is it come to this, have you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo many things in vain! What? Love Chriſt Jeſus leſs! whom you can never love enough, and once thought ſo? Doth long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſuch a Friend, procure deſires of his abſence? God forbid: Would you not walk with him now, and talk with him now? yea take ſweet counſel together, as you were wont to do? Do you ſavour the things of the earth ſo much, and the things of Heaven ſo little, that now your Lords company is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome? Can you not go with him, run with him, Faſt with him, Pray with him, weep with him, yea and bleed with him? Hath he
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:123663:125"/> not done all this for you? <hi>He was made ſin for us, that knew no ſin; wounded for our tranſgreſſions; pierced for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him; and with his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. Iſa. 53. 5. But I ſhall proceed briefly to ſix Cauſes of this great Decay.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Forgetfulneſs of that periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Chriſt found us in at firſt acquaintante: <hi>And when I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thy own blood; I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live; then waſhed I thee with water, yea, I throughly waſhed away thy blood, and anointed thee with oyl,</hi> Eccleſ. 16. 6, 9. compared with Chap. 36. 11. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniquities and abominations.</hi> Here by comparing our eſtate with Iſraels eſtate, we may read our danger with Iſraels danger, who being apt to forget the condition God found them in, and redeemed them from, are charged to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>their own evil wayes:</hi> This Remembrance was that, that wrought ſuch high admiration in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>And I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath enabled me, that he counted me faithful, putting me into</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:123663:126"/> 
                     <hi>the Miniſtry, who was before a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and injurious.</hi> Clearly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that <hi>Pauls</hi> remembrance of Chriſts good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him in miſery, encreaſed his eſteem of Chriſts mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Cauſe may be this; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual withdrawing from that wonted familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we uſe to have with Chriſt; once if it were well with us, he muſt know it, and be praiſed for it; if it were evil with us, he muſt be told of it; and at the leaſt abſence, you could cry with the Spouſe, <hi>Tell me O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt and cauſeſt thy flock to reſt at noon; for why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide, from the flocks of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi> Cant. 1. 17. Thus in a holy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimacy claims his company; if now ſuch diſcover ſtrangeneſs to him in being ſtrangers to his Fould; in a word, at every Chriſtians ſervice, now ſeldome, though once often; thus neglecting the means of encreaſe, muſt needs cauſe decreaſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The third Cauſe may be this; Deep declinings to heart acquaintance; The watch now over the heart is not ſo ſtrict as once; it was ſo tender in times paſt, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comer in and goer out, muſt be under ſtrict examination, who they were for, whether or
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:123663:126"/> no they went Chriſt Jeſus earand; but now the door of the heart is ſet open too too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, at hours too unſeaſonable, for reaſons too ſlender, to the entertaining many a ſtrange face that never was wont to come there, ſince the King of Glory had taken his poſſeſſion; for this <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complains againſt Jeruſalem, <hi>How long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> They <hi>kept not their heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, knowing that out of it are the iſſues of life;</hi> But truſting it too much were deceived and turned aſide thereby.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A fourth Cauſe may be this; Decaying in love to Chriſts Children; once your chief delight was with the Saints, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that excelled in vertue; now dayly decaying in your love to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them: This Chriſt Jeſus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an unerring reaſon, <hi>He that loveth his Brother abideth in the light, and there is no occaſion of ſtumbling in him,</hi> 1 John 2. 10. <hi>If any man ſay, I love God, and hates his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a lyer; for he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can be love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> Chap. 4. 20. Plainly aſſerting, the impoſſibility of loving the greater, if we love not the leſſer; ſo that to what degree there is decay in one, there is the ſame in the other.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:123663:127"/>
                  <p> Fifthly, The fifth Cauſe may be this; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of affection to periſhing things; At your firſt acquaintance with Chriſt, the world and its offers was contemned by you, now it is eſteemed; you had once a holy careleſneſs for the things of this life, now an unholy carefulneſs for them; then you ſate at Jeſus feet, hearing his word, but now cumbered with much ſerving; <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> Meaning whoſoever <hi>loves the world</hi> at ſuch a rate as to be more thoughtful after its vanities than Heavens excellencies; <hi>For the love of Money is the root of all evil; which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, A ſixth Cauſe may be this; The withdrawings of the holy Spirit, that was once pleaſed, and did then viſit you often; but now is grieved, and viſits you ſeldome; that once helped you much againſt temptations, laying for dead the deeds of the body, now lets you alone to be beaten and baffled with every evil motion, and this as the effect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits withdrawing, whoſe work where ever it is, being to greaten the eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:123663:127"/> and foil temptations of every kind, if not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, grieved and hindred, for fear of which are thoſe high Chriſtian Precepts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to <hi>vex it, quench it,</hi> or <hi>grieve it;</hi> and that becauſe, as our natural body without life is voyd of action, ſo without the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a Chriſtian man dry and barren, at beſt but like the Fig-tree, ſomething only in ſhew, yet curſed by Jeſus Chriſt for want of fruit: When the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> comes to ſpeak of ſome, that in the laſt dayes ſhould turn Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, walking after their own ungodly luſts, mark how they are charactrized out; <hi>Theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Spirit; </hi>
                     <hi>Jude</hi> reckons them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for filthineſs, calls them Raging Waves, Wandring Stars, Murmurers, Complainers, worſe than natural Bruit-beaſts, and the ſum of all, <hi rend="blackletterType">As being deſtitute of the Spirit.</hi> In the midſt of all <hi>Davids</hi> languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for fear of ſo high a loſs, is not this one of his moſt bitter cries? <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence; and </hi>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">Take not thy holy Spirit from me, </hi>
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11.</p>
                  <p>I have now done, having caſt my poor Mite into Gods publick Treaſury, as one Lift if God will, to encourage the growing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:123663:128"/> and reduce the decaying Chriſtian; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be bettered by it, I have my end, let God have the Honour; To whom, through Jeſus Chriſt, by the help of the Holy Spirit, be all due Praiſes aſcribed, in Heart, with Tongue and Converſation, for ever and ever; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
